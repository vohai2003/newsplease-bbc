We were in a really poor run away from home, it's been well documented. It was about us as a team coming together, the staff and the players, to correct that.\n\"We've done it very well. Three away performances, three victories, the first time in the club's history in the Premiership. Really proud of the group.\n\"Going into the game, and at half-time as well, we told the group to do the difficult things, stand up to Kilmarnock, we did that throughout the game. We could have been tidier in the final third, but we got one moment of quality.\n\"It was a really good passage of play, Noah Chilvers shows good composure, and George Harmon arrives right on the spot with a great finish.\n\"It gives us belief and confidence. We know what we've got in the group. We're at the bare bones today, we've got seven players out injured, but we've rallied together in an intense period of time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c1elxdjxpvzo"}
