I want back to back to back.\"\nA year later, they are on the brink of doing just that as Mahomes has led the Chiefs back to the NFL's championship game.\nIf they win in New Orleans on Sunday they will become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls.\nTheir date with destiny is against the Philadelphia Eagles, the team they beat to begin their Super Bowl trilogy two years ago.\nAnd some of the world's biggest celebrities are heading to arguably the greatest Super Bowl city - as well as Donald Trump, who will become the first sitting US president to attend America's biggest sport event.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckgn0478l7eo"}
