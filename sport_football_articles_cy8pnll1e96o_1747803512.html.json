They've got more points now than they had all of last season. It's been a terrific achievement.\"\nHaving left Forest in 1981, O'Neill returned in 2019 when he was appointed manager. However, he was sacked after just five months.\n\"I wasn't there long enough to put the shoes into the room,\" he recalled. \"I was there for 19 games. Strangely enough we won the last three games.\n\"I came in a January period [but] I didn't spend a penny on a player. I wish now Mr [Evangelos] Maranakis, having forked out in the region of Â£400m the last couple of years, might have minded about 30 bob to buy a centre-half. It didn't materialise.\n\"It was 19 games - I wish I hadn't bothered.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy8pnll1e96o"}
