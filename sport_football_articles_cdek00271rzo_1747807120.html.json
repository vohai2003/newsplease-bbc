The difficulties today were that Leicester City were performing well and it is difficult to beat them.\n\"In the second half, we were getting better and creating chances, not very clear chances but enough to score the two goals like we did.\n\"That match with those three points is fantastic for us. We are starting the second half of the season winning here at home and we are feeling the confidence again.\n\"Those three points are very important. We keep trying to get stronger.\n\"Our challenge now is to play two away matches in a row against Everton and Arsenal. I hope we can get enough points to be in the top 10 or top eight.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdek00271rzo"}
