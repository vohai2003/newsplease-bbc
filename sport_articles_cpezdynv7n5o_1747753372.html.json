So happy, because a striker needs to score for confidence and trust.\"\nHe added: \"La Liga is also competitive but he also needs to adapt to the Premier League. The tempo is higher than La Liga, transitions, being connected with the game. They are things that make the Premier League one of the best but one of the most competitive and excellent in terms of physicality and conditioning.\n\"He needs to improve in his physical condition, it is only the beginning of pre-season and he arrived late, he didn't start with us in the beginning.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cpezdynv7n5o"}
