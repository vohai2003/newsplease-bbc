They have been in the top three for the majority of the season with a fairly limited budget.\nBloomfield has changed Wycombe's style of football from a fairly direct team under his predecessor Gareth Ainsworth to a quicker, more attacking, style with the emphasis on getting players into the opposition penalty box.\nHis Wycombe team have scored the most goals in the EFL and had the most touches in the box.\nHis character is a major plus point too. Bloomfield is well respected within the game and conducts himself with great integrity and honesty.\nLuton will hope he can replicate his success at Kenilworth Road. He inherits a squad short in confidence and belief.\nHe will be delighted that his first game in charge is at home where the majority of Luton's wins have come from.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn0y17wrp8ko"}
