Amorim made some clever substitutions.\n\"In the second half there was more urgency and more penetration. They scored two really good goals and he will be pleased with this result.\"\nEx-England goalkeeper Paul Robinson added: \"It was a very professional performance from Manchester United away in Europe.\n\"On paper it looked tricky, but they have got the result they thoroughly deserve.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr7el27n3mzo"}
