We're insulted. We're mad. We're angry.\"\nHer comments come after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called that a \"very dumb thing to do\" and announced retaliatory tariffs.\nHowever, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump would \"probably\" announce a deal to reduce tariffs on Wednesday.\nIn response, Joly told the BBC that \"at the end of the day, the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump\".\nShe said no Trump administration secretaries had contacted their Canadian counterparts on Monday or Tuesday about tariffs.\nTrump and Trudeau, however, are expected to speak over the phone on Wednesday morning, according to sources who spoke to CNN and the Toronto Star.\nTrump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on 4 February, but delayed implementation until 4 March. Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford implemented a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from Canadian power.\nTrump also imposed a 10% tariff on goods worth more than $800 (£645) from China in February, which doubled in March. China responded with its own tariffs.\nThe White House said when it introduced the tariffs , externalthat it was \"taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country\".\nFentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.\nTrudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US.\nCanada had introduced new border security measures in December, in response to Trump's tariff threats before he took office.\n\"We didn't want this trade war. We did everything that was required under the executive order to make sure our border was safe and secure,\" Joly told the BBC, but said \"this is a bogus excuse on the part of the Trump administration against us\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg198xxy1xo"}
