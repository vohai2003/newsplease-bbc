We're just really happy to have him back.\"\nGueye also returned to Everton after time elsewhere - moving to Paris St-Germain from 2019 to 2022 - and was aware of the club's recent struggles when choosing to move back from the French giants.\n\"I knew it would be difficult but I was ready for this,\" he added.\n\"That's why I came back - to fight with my team-mates, to fight for the club and try to get the club in the best position.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c99pryn3180o"}
