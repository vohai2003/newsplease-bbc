Winning the Club World Cup is probably a reach given the strength of the other European heavyweights involved.\nHowever the league plays out, just as much of a worry will be if the team continues to have problems cohesively moving the ball up the pitch and controlling games and fails to get back to the form that briefly saw the club within reach of Liverpool in December.\nRegardless of how the season plays out, one of the biggest hopes is that several players show themselves to be important pieces for the future. This includes the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Jadon Sancho and Wesley Fofana, as well as Noni Madueke and Nicholas Jackson upon their returns. If they do not, that adds even more positions to the summer transfer target list.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cqx004103l3o"}
