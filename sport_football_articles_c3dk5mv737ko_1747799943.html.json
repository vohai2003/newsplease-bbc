I actually think they've looked a better team.\n\"[Strand Larsen] has got 11 goals this season, four in his past three games. Wolves have won three games and drawn one. So that tells you the answer about what are they going to do without their best player.\n\"He was a nuisance. His hold-up play was excellent and I thought his touch and his control were superb.\n\"Wolves didn't play that well in the first half, but they certainly improved in the second. When you've got a guy who's 6'4, you have to get balls into the box, and they certainly did that in the second half.\"\nSince Pereira took over at Molineux, Wolves have won more points than Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester put together.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3dk5mv737ko"}
