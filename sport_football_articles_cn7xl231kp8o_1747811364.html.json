Rovers looked short of confidence and very limited going forward.\nPompey's decision to tighten things up rather than go for a second after the break was fully vindicated.\nIt was a much-needed win after two disappointing defeats before the international break.\nNow, a couple more victories should be enough from here to secure Championship status.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn7xl231kp8o"}
