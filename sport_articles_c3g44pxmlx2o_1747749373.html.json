He is passionate and loves what he is doing.\n\"The way we play as well, you have to be tuned in. You have to know everyone's position. As a striker, you have to do a few more different things which you might not have to do for a different team. But that is good. It gives you extra knowledge.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3g44pxmlx2o"}
