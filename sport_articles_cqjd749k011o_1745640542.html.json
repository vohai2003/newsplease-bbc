We were excellent on the transitions and on the counter attack we got into dangerous areas.\n\"We worked two very good set plays. Especially the first one, it couldn't have panned out any better. We couldn't have been any happier at half time.\n\"Credit to Jimmy Thelin, he made positive changes going into the second half. They had to gamble at that point. They had so many attacking players on the park that eventually penned us back. We couldn't get up the pitch.\n\"The three games in the space of eight days took its toll on the players in the end. That's what has cost us in the end.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cqjd749k011o"}
