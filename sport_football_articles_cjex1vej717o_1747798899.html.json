They have made it so difficult and they have picked up a lot of points from teams which are in competition with us. We knew we had to be very intense to cope with their intensity levels.\n\"As expected, a difficult game. They are so intense. They keep on going and keep on running. You know you need a bit of luck to win a game like this.\"\nOn the penalty decision: \"At the time, no doubt for me. All of a sudden he is tripped and I assume he got a touch. Otherwise, he continues his run and tries to score. I'm always unhappy when we concede a penalty. Sometimes you concede penalties when it's not a big chance, so I understand some frustration [from Bournemouth].\nOn Liverpool's Premier League form: \"I think a lot about football, but I don't dream about football. It is special to win so many games away from home - the away the fans are supportive.\"\nOn watching Arsenal play Manchester City tomorrow: \"Yes, I definitely will - but then the Ajax game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjex1vej717o"}
