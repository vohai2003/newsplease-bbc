In the first 20 or 30 minutes, Chelsea were clearly the better team and deserved to take the lead but, in the last 10 to 15 minutes of the first half, we started to play forwards and then we were in the game.\n\"We were creating chances and everyone at Selhurst Park then gets the feeling 'we are back'. The fans had the feeling, the players had the feeling, and it was an excellent goal.\n\"We were giving them too much of the ball, losing it too quickly, but staying in the game was important. We always know we can score a goal and that's what we did at the end.\n\"You can feel and see that we are progressing. Having five points from three games is really positive. It is about how quickly we can pass the ball and find solutions.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2kxwwv99l4o"}
