The fans were amazing out there. They got us through that - I can tell you.\n\"It was giving the Tottenham fans stick and that was what we needed. That gave us the extra 10 minutes, the runs at the end and the boys were buzzing from it. That was amazing.\"\nOn the Blues' performance: \"We felt comfortable. We knew how they play and we knew how to hurt them. Today we played really well and we could've scored way more chances.\n\"We're fighting for Champions League and we need to win games. To win games, we have to change style sometimes. We knew they had a high line and we have Nicolas Jackson. He's a huge threat, into feet and in behind and we know if we play to his advantages we'll score goals. Today we did score goals through that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2dex4598ygo"}
