He’s a good man,\" said Rodgers.\n\"Ross County are very fortunate to have someone of that calibre as manager. He’s had a real challenging decade, but what I know from working with him is what a first-class manager he is, and coach and person.\n\"He's done a great job at County with limited resources. They had a great finish a couple of years ago and fought to stay in the league last season.\n\"Malky's teams always make it really difficult.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c99xqz8542go"}
