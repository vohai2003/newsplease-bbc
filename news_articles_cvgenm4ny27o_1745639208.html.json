It seems strangely coincidental that two schools in my constituency are facing closure within weeks of Labour introducing this policy,\" he told the BBC.\nHe said school places in Hertfordshire were \"already in exceptionally short supply\" and private schools closing would add \"unsustainable pressure on local state schools\".\nThe government said there was \"lots of evidence to suggest that there are more than enough state school places for pupils who may move from a private school\".\nSir Oliver claimed the extra VAT payment was creating \"anxiety for families\".\n\"I know people who have worked very hard to send their children to these schools\n\"In this part of Hertfordshire, you've got a very diverse array of different schools. Many of the Hindu community work hard in sending their children there, as well as a large Jewish community. It's a very mixed cohort\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgenm4ny27o"}
