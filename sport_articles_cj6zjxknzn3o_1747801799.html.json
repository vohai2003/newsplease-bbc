The effort of the players, the movement of the players, the quality they showed was at a really good level. Overall I'm so pleased with the response.\n\"Nicolas Kuhn still has more to go. We play with fast wingers who have the possibility to create and score goals. For him and his numbers this season it's really impressive. He's doing very, very well.\n\"Luke McCowan gives everything every single day and deserves the opportunities that come to him. I know he'll be a wee bit frustrated with some of the errors but he makes a vital contribution to us every time he plays.\n\"There's still so many games to play, it's such a long season and there will be other markers along the way but at this moment in time the players have been fantastic. We've just got to recover now and look forward to Wednesday.\n\"We need to strengthen in general [in the January window]. We know what we're looking to do and we're 100% confident the club will do everything to support that. We have deals we want to do between now and the end of January.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cj6zjxknzn3o"}
