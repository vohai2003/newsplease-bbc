Ranked 14th in the Premier League for points gained on the road, their five consecutive away league losses have highlighted vulnerabilities that need addressing.\nThis week's trips to Everton and Arsenal present an immediate opportunity to reverse their fortunes. If Villa are serious about securing European football next season, they will be targeting at least three points from the two games.\nA third consecutive away trip sees them travel to Monaco in the Champions League, in the first of their two concluding group games this month.\nCurrently sitting fifth in the Champions League table, Villa must aim for a minimum of four points that will hopefully secure a top-eight finish and a coveted last-16 spot.\nNot only would this guarantee an extra 10m euro (Â£8.4m) in prize money, but it would also free up February's schedule of Champions League commitments. Otherwise, a congested calendar - including a potential 48-hour turnaround between an FA Cup tie against Tottenham and a European play-off game - could complicate and potentially derail Villa's progress on multiple fronts.\nThe January transfer window is also finally heating up. A deal for Borussia Dortmund forward Donyell Malen has been reported as a done, but Villa will also be hopeful that PSR can be navigated and a move for at least one much-needed defensive reinforcement can be completed.\nWith so much at stake, these next two weeks are a pivotal step to increasing the stakes at the business end of Villa's season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czrl7lzep1do"}
