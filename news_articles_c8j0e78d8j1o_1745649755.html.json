I struggle to wash my hair and put my hair up.\n\"There are things I can still do, but it's hard to go upstairs and there's a lot of overcompensation and funkier movements.\n\"When I go out to late-night bars people think I'm intoxicated because I walk funny.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8j0e78d8j1o"}
