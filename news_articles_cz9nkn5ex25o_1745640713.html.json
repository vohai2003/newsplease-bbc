And that's the objective of the exercise – a community shop, run by the community, for the community.\"\nMr Jackson said he was \"very, very excited\" to open the store after two years of work.\nVillagers were keen to tackle the \"inconvenience\" of having to travel to shops in Caistor or Brigg.\nElizabeth Harrison, 77, said it meant \"a lot to the community\". Previously, she had faced long drives if she had forgotten something.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9nkn5ex25o"}
