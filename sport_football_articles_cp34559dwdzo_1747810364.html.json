The group have been terrific at that this season.\n\"Burnley are a very good side with great depth, but I know we are capable of playing better so that's why there is frustration there.\n\"We blocked shots, put our bodies on the line and kept going to the end but we were a sloppy at times and a bit careless with the ball.\n\"They created a lot of chances. As the games goes on, you think 'can we nick a point here', but it wasn't to be.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp34559dwdzo"}
