We start working hard, in order to change Greece within a Europe that changes direction.\"\nIn order to secure the extension his government, a coalition of anti-austerity parties led by the radical left-wing Syriza alliance, pledged to raise revenue by cracking down on tax evasion and reviewing government spending.\nAt the same time, Mr Tsipras is committed to easing the hardship endured by Greeks, many of whom have seen their standard of living plummet since the financial crisis of 2008.\nHe told the cabinet in Athens that the government's first bill on Monday would be aimed at addressing what he called the \"humanitarian crisis\".\nMeasures to be tabled, he said, would include supplying free electricity to poor families, as well as housing for 30,000 people and debt relief for some individuals and companies.\nSeveral cars were set alight and shops and banks were damaged.\nEven if the bailout extension is ratified by the entire eurozone, Greece still faces the formidable task of trying to service its debt obligations.\nIt will need to flesh out its reform programme in detail by April and prove that reforms are bedding in before receiving a final disbursement of 7.2bn euros.\nIn the meantime, it has to repay several billion euros in maturing debts, including about 2bn euros to the IMF in March. Some 6.7bn in ECB bonds is due to mature in July and August.\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis suggested in an interview broadcast on Friday that his negotiating team had been deliberately vague in order to clinch the bailout extension.\n\"We're proud of the degree of ambiguity,\" he told Antenna TV in a pre-recorded TV interview. \"I'm using a term here, creative ambiguity.\"\nSuspicion about the Greek government's intentions persists in Germany despite approval for the bailout extension.\n\"Look at Tsipras, look at Varoufakis: would you buy a used car from them?\" Klaus-Peter Willsch, a dissident MP from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc, said in parliament.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31668779"}
