However some species such as alder, hazel and elm produce pollen earlier meaning it can start as soon as January.\nThe Met Office suggests that around 25% of hay fever sufferers are affected by tree pollen.\nGrass pollen, on the other hand, has more widespread impacts affecting nearly all sufferers during its season which runs from around May to July.\nThe third major trigger is weed pollen with a season that peaks between June and September.\nThe exact dates will vary depending on where you live while some areas with less vegetation - such as major towns and cities - are likely to have less pollen than rural locations.\nAccording to scientists at the University of Worcester this tree pollen season is expected to be more severe than average due to a combination of factors.\nDr Beverley Adams-Groom, senior palynologist and pollen forecaster, said: \"Trees that produce allergenic pollen in the UK tend to have alternating high and low years of severity â€“ this year is a high year.\"\nHigh temperatures during last spring and early summer meant there was the right weather for pollen production, with a warm May being a major factor.\nDr Adams-Groom added: \"Mild, dry weather with breezes provides the best conditions for pollen release and that is what is forecast for the next week or so.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/cwyd747q953o"}
