I don't think he can do that on one day and shake Donald Trump's hand the next.\"\nScottish ministers controversially granted planning permission for the course, overriding local councillors who denied the application.\nBut it ran into considerable opposition, not least from those who live nearby after Trump repeatedly demanded they move so the project could be completed.\nTrump accused local farmer and salmon fisherman Michael Forbes of living in a \"pig like atmosphere\".\nThe countryside agency NatureScot said after construction that sand dunes in the area no longer merited being retained as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\nQuestions have also been raised over the promised investment after it emerged the course had racked up Â£13.3m in losses since it opened, as of March 2024.\nThe original proposal included approval for a 450-room hotel, 950 holiday apartments, 36 golf villas and 500 houses.\nNone of those have materialised, and the course had an employee roll of just 81 as of March last year.\nWe had broadly expected to see Donald Trump pop up in Scotland at some point. The president owns two golf courses here, and his mother famously hails from the Isle of Lewis.\nBut his trip has taken on a whole different level of pomp now, with the prime minister hand-delivering an invitation from the King to visit a royal estate.\nIt was part of a charm offensive - which included the gift of a golf cap in Trump's family tartan - which seems to have paid off for Sir Keir Starmer, at least in the form of warm words.\nThe invite was calculated to play to the president's ego - Mr Trump always loves the idea of being the first in history to get something, and Sir Keir repeatedly underlined that this is the first time a president has been offered a second state visit rather than a lunch at Windsor Castle.\nThe prime minister has to break bread with the US president regardless of how well their views and values might mesh, and that attitude is mirrored by First Minister John Swinney.\nHe may have backed Mr Trump's rival Kamala Harris during the election, but he took a call from the president-elect following his win.\nAnd he's hinted that he could try to use Mr Trump's roots to try to avoid the prospect of tariffs being imposed on Scottish goods being imported to the US - which after all is a big market for things like whisky.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly4403gjxdo"}
