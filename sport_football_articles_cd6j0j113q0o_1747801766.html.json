They have had a good season, and beaten all the teams in the top five apart from Liverpool, but it is in danger of fizzling out.\nThat would be a shame, and not just for their players. Cherries boss Andoni Iraola could do with a strong finish to the campaign to ensure his reputation continues to grow.\nIt finished 1-1 when these two sides met at Vitality Stadium before Christmas and I am pretty sure the BBC readers will go for a draw this time too.\nWest Ham have struggled at home of late, losing three of their past four there, with their only win coming against Leicester.\nBournemouth's form doesn't suggest they will take the points either, but I am not sitting on the fence like I expect you lot will.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd6j0j113q0o"}
