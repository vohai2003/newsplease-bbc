Last season Spurs did not participate in European competition and earned just £1.3m, a stark contrast to the £56.2m made in 2023 when they reached the Champions League round of 16 in the prior year.\nMeanwhile, Tottenham's profit from operations increased by 4% to £144.9m from £138.7m.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjl4482351o"}
