He stood out as a principled footballer.\n\"We are therefore very disappointed by his decision and the hurt and division it has created.\n\"The very essence of the Liverpool supporters board is to be inclusive and ensure all Liverpool fans, whatever their faith, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability can attend and enjoy football.\n\"That's what we want for fans, that's what we want for football. We stand in solidarity with our allies from Kop Outs, Liverpool's LGBT+ Fans Group.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn0z71017d2o"}
