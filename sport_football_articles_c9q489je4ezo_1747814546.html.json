At least that would guarantee a new, or long-time waiting name on the cup.\nPhil answered: You may have a point because everyone loves an underdog and Bournemouth will be underdogs here. I do agree it is refreshing to see the FA Cup so open this season but it is Manchester City's single trophy hope and they won't care about the romanticism a Bournemouth win might bring. I'm at The Vitality Stadium on Sunday and really looking forward to it.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9q489je4ezo"}
