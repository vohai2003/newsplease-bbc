You have to fight and we fought and got the three points. Very important.\n\"It doesn't matter how we score, it is about fighting to survive. Luckily the goalkeeper passed it out and I had to be there to finish it.\"\nOn whether this result could be a turning point: \"Yeah. When you are in this situation as a team, where even though you play good you lose, it is difficult. But, hopefully it is a new beginning.\n\"It is all about training and taking each game at a time. We try to fight to get points. That's what we are here for - to fight and to try to survive.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjdejzx07veo"}
