And rightly so.\nAfter turning around a league campaign that looked destined to be a relegation battle, now all the talk is of looking upwards and chasing fifth, fourth or perhaps even third place.\nAnd after exiting the League Cup early on there should now be a determination to ensure there is a lengthy run in the Scottish Cup.\nOf course you need a bit of good fortune with the draw and a home game against Clydebank is probably one of those ties supporters would wish for.\nOlder readers will remember 'The Bankies' of the 1970s, with the likes of Davie Cooper performing his wizardry on the wing.\nAlthough they have had various reincarnations over the years, the club have recently been performing well in the West of Scotland league and remain unbeaten in their 10 matches played.\nNevertheless this should be a game Hibernian win with some ease and give the home fans a belief another Scottish Cup success can be achieved this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5y7xrlzy0vo"}
