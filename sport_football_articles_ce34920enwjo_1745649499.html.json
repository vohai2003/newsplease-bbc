There was so much promise, we scored early, looked good, lost control and then thought we had won it. There was so much effort in extra time, but we weren't good enough to win.\n\"I'm hugely disappointed for [Anthony] Gordon. He is a huge player and instrumental for us. We will review it, see what we make of it and make the next steps. I haven't spoken to him individually.\n\"[Alexander] Isak had some tightness in his body, but not an injury. The longer it went on, the greater the risk so he was taken off before any problems.\n\"We need the week to dust ourselves down and regroup, as we have been tested. We had a small squad, we couldn't get Sven [Botman] fit and we can't afford to lose anyone else.\n\"It's an opportunity missed, I felt that. It's tough and hugely disappointing but there is nothing we can do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce34920enwjo"}
