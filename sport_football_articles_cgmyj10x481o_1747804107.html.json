We defend as a whole team, as a unit.\n\"If you watch the strikers in the game, they're probably fed up running all the way back - but that's what we're about as a team.\n\"As long as we can keep clean sheets, we know we're in with a chance of winning the game.\n\"After the run we went on - the drawing - we probably thought we'd be further away from it [European places], but we weren't.\n\"We know we've got a big second half of the season coming up and we want to be back in Europe - that's our challenge. Those were our thoughts at the start of the season so we are still in a position to do that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgmyj10x481o"}
