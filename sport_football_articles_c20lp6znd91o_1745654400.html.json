Right now, that is exactly what the very top of the Premier League, isn't. This is no indictment of Liverpool or indeed their style, but a question about the also rans. This isn't the best group of teams in recent Premier League history, but it still shouldn't reflect negatively on Liverpool's achievements.\nArne Slot's men seemed to manage Manchester City 2-0, rather than beat them 2-0 at the Etihad. That doesn't mean they aren't capable of being swashbuckling, it is just that they scarcely need to fully exert themselves that often. There is a maturity about their play and their game management is way ahead of anyone else. These are the reasons, along with the incomparable Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk being at another level to anyone else around in their positions, why Liverpool are unlikely to stumble enough to be caught now.\nI understand why some Liverpool fans feel praise for their team has been muted, and they have a point, but football fans want that excitement and uncertainty in their league campaign.\nRemember that before this season's downfall, many were getting bored with Man City's crushing dominance, mostly because it was based on a predictable, ultra-controlled possession style. It was admired more than loved by the end.\nDon't worry about Liverpool however, they will be buckling their swash again by the end of the season, but it may take the latter stages of the Champions League for them to show exactly how exciting they can be.
