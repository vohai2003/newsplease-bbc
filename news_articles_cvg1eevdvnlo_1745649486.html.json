Other care providers should look to this report to see what they can learn,\" the CQC added.\nResidents and relatives told inspectors they felt able to complain and were confident action would be taken and improvements would be made, the report said.\nOne resident told an inspector: \"I like the staff, because they make me feel at home. They take me on lots of trips that I've really enjoyed.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg1eevdvnlo"}
