If you follow your DNA and your style, you can lose - but it is not a problem for me.

When we have needed him, he is always in a good way and is an important player for us. He played the last part of last season very well.\"\nOn the future of Moises Caicedo: \"I'm happy if he stays and plays with us. We have to be ready to find another midfielder if he leaves.\"\nHe was impressed by Joao Pedro's debut against Chelsea: \"The first game was incredible. I pushed the club to bring him in as I believe a lot in his quality. We have other big players in attack.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c88v47dl89jo"}
