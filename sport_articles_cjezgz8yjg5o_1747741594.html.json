He’s still only 27 and has the capacity to be a match winner, with pace, trickery and a goal threat.\nUnfortunately, he hasn’t delivered top marks often enough. To be fair to Gray, the lack of a focal point at the top end of the pitch, for much of his time at Everton, has definitely reduced his effectiveness. He only cost £2m and his current market value is way more than that.\nBut if Everton are considering selling him, they need to have someone better coming through the door.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjezgz8yjg5o"}
