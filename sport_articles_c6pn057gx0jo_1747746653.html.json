Tottenham have got an asset who's worth £80m, £90m, maybe even £100m. He's in the final year of his contract. He wants to go, he's wanted to go for at least 12 months.\n\"He's broken the Tottenham goalscoring record, he probably feels that's a box ticked, and who quite frankly wouldn't want to go to Bayern Munich?\n\"The one thing he's not had at Tottenham is silverware, we all know that. He's done very well for his country, he's done brilliantly in the Premier League. He can go to Bayern Munich for two years. They are about as guaranteed a silverware-winning machine as you will find anywhere in Europe.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c6pn057gx0jo"}
