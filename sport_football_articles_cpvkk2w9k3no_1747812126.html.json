To lift that trophy after starting my career lifting the play-off trophy at Palace could probably not have been written better.\n\"A special, special day and a moment I will never forget.\n\"The atmosphere that will be at Selhurst Park [tonight] will be like no other. There will be a buzz around the place because everyone is still on cloud nine.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpvkk2w9k3no"}
