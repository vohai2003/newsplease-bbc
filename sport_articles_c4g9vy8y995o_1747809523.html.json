Tom Jordan at 12 tells me they are going for it. Good bench. Good luck boys, we're going to need it against the green machine.\nAlan: This is the best team available. I cannot think of any permutations that could improve it other than the injured players recovering.\nRusty: The team is about as strong as we can put out with Sione Tuipulotu missing. So glad to see Jordan stepping into 12. It could be a Titanic battle in the centres, let's hope it's the Irish ship that sinks. The back row is abrasive. 15 v 15 is very matched but Irish have the advantage across the 23 v 23. Hopefully, the starting boys can get the job done early, I fear not.\nStair: The omission of George Horne seems odd. To my mind, he is the second-best scrum half in the competition, behind Jamison Gibson-Park. Brave to start Pierre Schoeman on the bench. I understand the impact theory but the first half against an Irish team is critical. However, a strong bench will help to drive towards an 80-minute performance.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g9vy8y995o"}
