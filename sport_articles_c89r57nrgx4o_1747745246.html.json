He fizzed one angled effort over the bar and forced a fine save from another having slipped free of his marker and broken into the penalty area.\nWolves broke their transfer record to sign Silva, then aged 18 and one of Europe's hottest prospects, from Porto for Â£35m in 2020.\nHis first two seasons at Wolves were a struggle, but a year of playing regular first-team football on loan at Anderlecht and PSV Eindhoven appears to have done him the world of good on the evidence of his pre-season outings.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c89r57nrgx4o"}
