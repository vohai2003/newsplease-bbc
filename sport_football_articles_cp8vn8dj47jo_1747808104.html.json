No relegation battle to be concerned with is the main reason and Everton certainly have nothing to lose.\nMotivation should be no issue. Wednesday's Merseyside derby comes quickly after what was an explosive fixture at Goodison Park; a throwback performance that epitomised everything that local rivalry means, I am sure there will some spill over into the return fixture.\nAbdoulaye Doucoure will surely be a target after playing a starring role in instigating the post-match melee in February.\nThere are scores to be settled and the small matter of an opportunity to slightly postpone the champions elect from popping the champagne corks.\nDavid Moyes' Anfield track record does not make for pleasant reading. No wins across his managerial career does not elevate our hopes of taking three points.\nSo often accused of taking a knife to a gun fight against the better sides, his starting XI and tactical set-up will be interesting.\nHe has spoken about being able to play with more freedom as the season meanders to its conclusion. Hopefully this message trickles into the thinking on Wednesday, but it will certainly need to be tapered and controlled given the attacking prowess the opposition has.\nGiven Liverpool's recent downturn in form, negativity surrounding a certain right-back and Arne Slot's Goodison Park head loss, this is a real opportunity for us to upset the apple cart.\nMaybe I am dreaming, but do not bet against us.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8vn8dj47jo"}
