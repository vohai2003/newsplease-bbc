At the moment, I can't tell you how busy we are with people phoning us with issues such as homelessness and rental costs,\" she said.\n\"It's become a mission of mine because when you are volunteering, you see the effect of Citizens Advice and the help it gives to people and how it changes their lives.\"\nSarah Archer, chief executive, adds Lewes District Citizens Advice is local and independent charity that supports people across Lewes District.\nMs Bayliss is set to travel to Nepal on 22 March.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4v8dgvdkgo"}
