Some of the goals we scored were fantastic goals. We were clinical on the break and we kept the clean sheet, which is always a good sign.\n\"[Lawrence Shankland] has looked like [the real deal] in training. Maybe he just needed that little break to freshen himself up physically and mentally. He has looked sharper in his mind in training. It is no surprise he scored like that today.\n\"Elton [Kabangu] is a terrific guy. Brilliant person to have around every day. He is so positive. Brilliant with his team-mates, a humble guy, and a constant threat. He wants to score goals.\n\"We deserved to win the game. This is a tough place to come to. No complacency. If we step off, and think we are something else, this game can bite you on the backside very quickly.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckgrk40lm15o"}
