Another 30,000 would be told to stay home.\nThe impasse has been complicated by a judge temporarily blocking Mr Obama's immigration executive action. The US immigration agency is under the purview DHS.\nIn November, Mr Obama directed US officials to protect immigrant parents of US citizens or legal permanent residents from deportation, as well as expand a previous programme doing the same for young migrants brought to the US illegally by their parents.\nSenator Lindsay Graham said on Sunday he was \"willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let this play out in court\".\n\"Now we've got a perfect reason to not shut down because the courts have decided, at least initially, in our favour,\" Senator John McCain told broadcaster MSNBC.\nBut other Republicans, including a few governors attending a White House meeting on Monday, have argued Congress should stand firm on what they see as an unconstitutional power grab by Mr Obama.\nMr Obama is set to meet governors during the last day of the conference on Monday - but has not shown any willingness to drop his executive action in exchange for the department's funding.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31591653"}
