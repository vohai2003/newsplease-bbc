It was a tough game, very emotional.\n\"It was difficult to get control in the game and we were not able to do this over the 90 minutes. We have to analyse that and find out why.\n\"It is a very young group and they learn from these mistakes. We have to help them get better. It is very important not to overreact. It is about staying together and seeing the positive things.\n\"It is very important to be very honest with one another.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g294l85pyo"}
