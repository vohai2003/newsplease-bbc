They have now won just one of their last four on the road following draws against both Dundee clubs, defeat at Rangers and Saturday's victory at Ross County.\nThat slight, slight blip away from home will almost certainly not impact their pursuit of another Premiership crown, but Rodgers will be keen to address that, plus their slackness in defence, with big Champions League games on the horizon.\nThe Celtic boss will also be disappointed by his team's inability to put the game to bed before Dundee grabbed their first equaliser, with Adam Idah's form a worry.\nThe former Norwich striker, who failed to get on the end of a dangerous Kyogo Furuhashi cross at close range with Celtic one up, is now without a goal in 12 games and was removed on the hour after failing to have a notable impact on the match.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4gzp492gx9o"}
