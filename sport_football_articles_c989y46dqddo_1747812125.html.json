The Old Trafford side have never gone seven without victory against Spurs, and have also never lost four successive matches against them.\nTottenham have won the Uefa Cup/Europa League twice (1972 and 1984) and victory on Wednesday would see them become the second English club to win it three times, along with Liverpool. The only side to win the competition on more than three occasions are Sevilla (seven).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c989y46dqddo"}
