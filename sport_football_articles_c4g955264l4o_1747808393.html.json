We didn't score against Leeds and quickly the narrative swings that we're a really boring team,\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\"But that was the game, it wasn't a classic.\n\"What we did manage to do was incredible on the defensive side of things but what we didn't manage to execute was us trying to be a bit of a threat, but we keep working on that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g955264l4o"}
