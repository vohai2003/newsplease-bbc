Victor Moses swung in a corner which the home side were unable to deal with as Crouch stuck out a leg to finish from inside the six-yard box.\nIt was the only high point in an otherwise disappointing match for Stoke as Blackburn reacted positively with forward King causing numerous problems. However, he could only hit the bar from a presentable opportunity, before neatly nodding in the leveller.\nGestede fluffed a glorious chance just before the turning point of the match.\nFormer Manchester United forward King was barged over in the penalty area by last man Cameron - who received a straight red card - and Frenchman Gestede calmly slotted home his 14th goal of the season.\nBowyer's men were firmly in control and extended their lead further in the second half. King completed his treble in the space of four minutes - both with cool finishes after running clear of the Stoke defence.\nGestede had a header kept out by City keeper Jack Butland, and Craig Conway shot wide after a mazy run, as Blackburn progressed into the last eight.\nBlackburn manager Gary Bowyer:\n\"It was a hell of a cup tie. We have immense pride for the supporters and it is a terrific result for the club.\n\"We were extremely disappointed to concede a soft goal but the lads bounced back from that.\n\"We will enjoy tonight but I said to the players, we have to focus on Cardiff for our next game. We would like another home draw but we will take each game as it comes.\"\nStoke manager Mark Hughes:\n\"We were well beaten today, credit to Blackburn, they put the ball in good area and used the threats they had up front. We didn't deal with it all afternoon, we got our noses in front without really dictating Blackburn. We allowed them to get back into the game.\n\"We couldn't deal with the pair of them [Rudy Gestede and Josh King]. All in all, a poor performance from us.\n\"We wanted to progress and I couldn't emphasise the point enough in the lead up to the cup games, but we need to get our heads down this week and not let our season peter out.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31423138"}
