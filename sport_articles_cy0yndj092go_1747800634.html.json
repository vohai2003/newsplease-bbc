They came out firing, which we knew they would. It was a tough encounter against a very strong line side, but ecstatic with the win.\n\"I guess the growth in this team now is how we can sustain that pressure, be relentless with it and then start fast again that second half.\n\"I guess it's a mentality thing. I think we're on a nice run now and there's a lot of belief in the squad and we've just got to be a bit more ruthless in those situations.\n\"We want to win silverware, but we don't want to look too far ahead. It's next week mentality, so we've just got to focus on the positives from today, but there's a good few things we can improve on to get better as a team and take that into next week.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy0yndj092go"}
