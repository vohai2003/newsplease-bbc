Maybe that's what we're seeing impact on the players.\"\nEngland head coach Steve Borthwick is leading an international team for the first time, having previously worked as an assistant with England and Japan. He also led Leicester to the Premiership title in 2022.\nWhen he took charge of England, Borthwick recruited Richard Wigglesworth and Kevin Sinfield â€“ both of whom are less than a decade into their coaching careers - from his Tigers backroom.\nDefence coach Joe El-Abd is working in international rugby for the first time and splitting his time between England and second-tier French side Oyonnax until the end of the season, while, at 33, scrum coach Tom Harrison is younger than hooker Jamie George.\nFelix Jones, who was part of the coaching team that won back-to-back Rugby World Cups with South Africa, left England's set-up in August after only seven months in his post. Jones has now returned to work with the Springboks once more.\n\"I still think we're way off the potential of this team and let's just hope we start seeing that,\" added Carling, who had a part-time mentoring role with England under Borthwick's predecessor Eddie Jones.\nEngland vice-captain Ellis Genge said last week former players such as Carling were \"out of touch\" in their criticism of the team, failing to give them due credit for turning around a run of six defeats in seven Tests earlier in the year.\n\"I wouldn't necessarily agree with him,\" Carling said. \"A lot of ex-players are hugely experienced and have a lot of knowledge.\n\"But I understand that when you're a current player you're highly sensitive.\n\"You're trying as hard as you can to win games [and] they've had a tough run. Let's be honest, we're talking a tough run for three or four years now. That's where players have to understand people will have opinions.\n\"I remember all these times we had some very ugly wins and you watch the reaction of the media and the fans.\n\"It is a bit frustrating but you have to take a deep breath and accept that's part and parcel of it.\"\nCarling captained England 59 times, leading them to three Grand Slams and a Rugby World Cup final during the 1990s.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/articles/cdrx352jzkko"}
