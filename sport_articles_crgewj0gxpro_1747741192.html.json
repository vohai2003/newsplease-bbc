Motherwell look decent too, but we more than held our own and, with a little bit of luck (two off the post and one comfortably off the line) in the second half, we may of had more.\"\nIain: \"If that was either of the Old Firm, it'd be a penalty! It's a hand ball. I think (hope) we are underestimated this season and we can kick on. We should have taken all three points comfortably in the second half alone.\nMark: \"I thought we were relatively comfortable up until Motherwell scored. We then fell out it a bit. But we had the grit and determination to get back into the game and deserved our goal. We then had a couple of chances to win it. Solid start to the season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crgewj0gxpro"}
