A fine achievement whatever way you look at it.\nRemember, United were playing in the second tier last year – so surviving in the top flight was the objective at the start of this campaign.\nAnd how they have exceeded that aim. What makes it all even more impressive is the fact Jim Goodwin completely rebuilt his squad last summer, a revamp that laid the foundations for what they have gone on to achieve.\nYes their form has dipped, but that was always going to happen at some point in the campaign.\nThis has been a wonderful season for United – and a European place would be the biggest of bonuses.\nIf f they can get to a situation where the fans are reaching for their passports, then you have to think Goodwin will be putting himself into manager of the year contention.\nThere is still a lot of water to flow under the Premiership bridge this season, with plenty yet to be decided.\nBut if I dare look to next term, the big challenge the United boss looks set to face is finding a way to build and improve on a campaign that has gone well beyond their early-season expectations.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2648l1l9xo"}
