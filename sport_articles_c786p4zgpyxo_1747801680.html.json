We didn't have any real control of the game at any point, Ross County looked a bit brighter than us early on.\n\"They were more alive and more alert to certain situations. That said, second half we played more in their half but we were a wee bit unconvincing. We huffed and puffed.\n\"We missed Vassell leading the line for us. There's reasons for why we weren't at our best but it was certainly a disappointing afternoon for us.\n\"We knew we had an opportunity to move into the top six with a win. Any opportunities to win a home game, you've got to try and do that but we weren't good enough.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c786p4zgpyxo"}
