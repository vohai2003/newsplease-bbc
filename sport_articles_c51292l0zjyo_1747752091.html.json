Obviously, we want to build our style of play, dominate games and surprise opponents by having control - with and without the ball.\n\"For that we need intelligent players. We need players who are committed to what the manager asks you to do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c51292l0zjyo"}
