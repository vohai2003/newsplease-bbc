His signing was clumsily announced by Hibs shortly after the club had announced his exit following the completion of an initial loan spell, and the rumours (incorrect as they may be) were that he'd been signed by accident.\nHe's been scapegoated and made a figure of fun by commentators and pundits who really should know better, so it's a huge credit to Rocky that he has come through such adversity to prove himself a key player in a squad sitting clear in third place.\nI hope Hibs can keep him. No doubt Rocky will have many suitors and he'll have his own ambitions but if he does leave, he will go having won round a Hibs support who have taken a real shine to him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c74n83l0qqno"}
