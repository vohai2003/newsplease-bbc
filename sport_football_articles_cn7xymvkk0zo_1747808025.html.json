It is the kind of congested calendar that can either forge heroes or drain momentum.\nFor Villa, the first of hopefully two trips to Wembley offers a vital safety net. Even if their Champions League push falters in the league and they come unstuck against PSG, the FA Cup provides a tangible shot at silverware and, crucially, a route to European football next season.\nWith Unai Emery having coached in European competition for 16 consecutive seasons, you sense it is almost non-negotiable - for him, for the club's upward trajectory and for a fan base now used to midweek continental nights.\nYet the stakes remain cruelly high. This team could end up in two finals and still walk away with nothing - no trophy, no Europe. That uncertainty might explain why Villa have not released their ticket prices for next season yet; the persona of next season could be entirely different depending on how this one finishes.\nIf you are Emery looking at the run-in, the first priority now is restoring clarity and calm. Strip back the noise. Nail down the strongest XI. Introduce rotation only where necessary, not for the sake of it.\nAnd, most importantly, get the players believing again that this is not a campaign to survive - it is one they can define. Because the moment the fear of failure overtakes the opportunity of glory, it has already gone.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn7xymvkk0zo"}
