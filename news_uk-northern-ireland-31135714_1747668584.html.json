She was given a inpatient bed in a psychiatric ward at Holywell hospital.\n\"When she had been admitted to Holywell, they had said it would be a six to eight-week process, a programme of care, but after three weeks, Fiona got home leave for two days,\" Mr McGeown said.\nHe said that she took only one of the home leave days offered to her, because \"she felt she couldn't handle the two days\" away from the hospital.\n\"She was home on the Sunday and arrived back then on the Monday morning to the ward and was told she was being discharged.\"\n\"She started to come round a bit, she was having a bit of fun, smiling. She was responding very well to the programme of care provided. She was taking her medication on a regular basis - something that she wouldn't have done.\n\"She would have been prescribed anti-depressants for a number of years prior to her taking her own life, but when she was in the ward at Holywell she was responding very well and very happy to be there.\"\nMr McGeown said he was \"so angry \" that they were sending his wife home early and pleaded with medical staff, but added it was clear the decision had been made.\n\"On discharge, she seemed to lose all hope.\"\nMr McGeown added that life has been very difficult for both him and his son since his wife's death.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-31135714"}
