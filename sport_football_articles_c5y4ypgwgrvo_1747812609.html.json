Alexander Isak, Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres - in that order.\nGuy: First objective has to be to clear out a few players who aren't good enough. That should free up the funds to buy some quality - selling Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko. We are all aware that we need quality in attack - and know other clubs know this as well so will raise the prices.\nLogan: I understand the appeal of making a big statement attacking signing. But for the continuance of the project we are doing, he has to look at committing key players to long-term contracts. I would start with William Saliba - he is arguably the best defender in the world, and will be for the next decade. It would also make a sale for Gabriel more expensive if anyone was to come in for him in summer.\nJames: Getting Buakyo Saka on a long-term contract.\nKyle: There should be only one objective... buy a striker! If you spend Â£100m, fine. Just get the 25-goal-a-season striker we've needed for years.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y4ypgwgrvo"}
