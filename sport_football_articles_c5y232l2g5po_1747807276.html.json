He will be a much-needed reinforcement in a position of need, even if that may come with added pressure to be the one that sparks life into an often one-dimensional attack.\nGlasner had been hoping that any attacking incoming transfer would also be joined by a returning Matheus Franca from injury, perhaps a 'new signing' in the cliched football sense, if not factual. The young Brazilian has not featured in a Palace squad since Glasner's second game in charge back at the start of March 2023.\nRepeated injuries have raised red flags about his future, and with no expectation he will be with the team until the spring, this is the next in a series of disappointing setbacks for the former Flamengo player.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y232l2g5po"}
