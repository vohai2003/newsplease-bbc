All that ends today.\"\nA man was banned from football matches for four years after he kicked Ramsdale in the back at the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium earlier this year.\nReflecting on that incident, Ramsdale said he felt bad for the individual, whom he believes would not have behaved that way had he been aware of what he was going through at the time.\nDuring a six-hour flight back to London from a post-World Cup holiday a few days before the match, Ramsdale's wife suffered a miscarriage.\n\"There's really no way that I can describe the pain of that six-hour flight back to London, even now,\" he said.\n\"I just want people out there to know that they're not alone if they're going through it themselves.\"\nHe added: \"The last few years especially, you see so much negativity and toxicity in football. Whether it's on social media or at the grounds, it feels like a lot of people have lost all perspective.\"\nRamsdale praised Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for the support he offered.\n\"Even in the middle of the title race, with so much pressure on the club, he asked me if I needed some time off to deal with everything,\" he said.\n\"Mikel went above and beyond to make sure me and my family were OK. For me, that's a manager.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66394989"}
