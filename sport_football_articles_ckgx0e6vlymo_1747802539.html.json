We have to react quickly because the Premier League is quick. If you're not compact, you get punished.\n\"I feel good [to be back starting] and it was good for my confidence to be in front of the fans. Hopefully in the next game we can do better - we have many games ahead of us so we have to focus and keep going.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckgx0e6vlymo"}
