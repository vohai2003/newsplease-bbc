We believed until the end. We should have won the game, we couldn't but we tried.\n\"We have to take the positives. We were a different team than a few games ago, we played a really good game. We have to believe more in what we can do.\"\nOn how the performance improved so much from recent games: \"We changed our mindset, the belief, the confidence. With confidence in every duel, in the passing and defending, we really enjoyed the game.\n\"If you saw the last few games, it was poor. It's true and we accept that. Today we played really well and we have to believe. Football really is mental.\"\nOn Manchester United's back three: \"We played with freedom today, playing without feelings. When you play like that, you can enjoy football. I'm really happy with the performance.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1j03e6rg39o"}
