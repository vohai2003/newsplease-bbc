We'll have to wait and see whether it [Walsh's injury] is serious.\n\"It's tough. You could see it disrupted our rhythm in the first half. It's always sad when you see your team-mate go down and I hope it is nothing too serious.\n\"We are a resilient group. We're going to keep going and fighting and putting our best foot forward - as we always do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66321252"}
