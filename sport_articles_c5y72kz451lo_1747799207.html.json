As a club, we have made positive strides forward under Ben's guidance, and he will be leaving the club in a better place.\n\"We're always looking at the future of the club, and after discussions with Ben, we mutually decided that it was the right time to part ways.\n\"We wish him nothing but the best moving forward.\"\nThe club added they will continue to be led by the board of directors as the recruitment for a new chief executive gets under way.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5y72kz451lo"}
