We have to take the momentum into Saturday.\n\"For us in the changing room, we know what we need to do, we just need to stay focused and keep doing what we are doing. We just need to keep grinding out results and hopefully by the split the gap is closer and we have more of a chance.\n\"He [Valakari] is really positive and believes in us. The players believe in ourselves so we just need to keep getting important victories.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cdellyrxk52o"}
