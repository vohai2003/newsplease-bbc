They were key contenders for relegation, and not many would have argued with it.\nJust four games later, they're suddenly knocking on the door of the top six - just two points off sixth-placed St Mirren - and have left the Saints in the dust.\nOf course, there is a long way to go and Cowie and his staff won't be counting their chickens for a long time yet, but this little run of form has made automatic relegation look very unlikely.\nIt's a run that they could only have dreamt of two weeks ago, with an away win still eluding them at that point. They now have won three Premiership away games in a row for the very first time in the club's existence.\nNot only an impressive run, but a historic one.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cq5lnj81632o"}
