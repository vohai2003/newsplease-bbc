To win the Treble says everything you need to know about the quality this team has.\n\"To have the chance to work with Pep Guardiola will be amazing. I know I am not yet the finished article and I am sure my game will progress under the best coach in football.\n\"To be linking up with [Croatia midfielder] Mateo Kovacic will also be special.\"\nHe is also relieved to be playing alongside, rather than against, Erling Haaland who scored five in the second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Gvardiol's RB Leipzig.\n\"Luckily, I'm on his side now and I don't have to take care of him anymore!\" he said.\n\"Everyone last season wanted to avoid City as a team. We knew it was going to be hard. It's unbelievable the way they play at home and the atmosphere. Also, the calmness on the ball - it was just a different level.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c9xjrnrgg78o"}
