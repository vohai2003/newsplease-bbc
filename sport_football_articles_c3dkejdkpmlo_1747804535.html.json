It's a really important period for setting strong foundations for both the transfer window and the season ahead,\" he said.\n\"In terms of attracting players, Notts County has many strong selling points. It's very difficult for clubs, even those from higher divisions, to compete with our brand, history, city, fanbase and project.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3dkejdkpmlo"}
