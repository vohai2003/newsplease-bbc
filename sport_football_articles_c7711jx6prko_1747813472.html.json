It was Maguire who scored the injury-time winner in the quarter-final against Lyon. It was Maguire who produced the mazy dribble and cross that created the crucial opener for Casemiro in the semi-final against Athletic Bilbao.\nMaguire is the kind of dependable figure Ruben Amorim needs right now. Maybe be lacks the speed and agility of someone like Leny Yoro.\nBut as they try to navigate such choppy waters, Maguire is a rock Amorim must cling to.\nHe missed the Europa League final defeat by Villarreal in 2021 and also the FA Cup success against Manchester City last season, both through injury.\nMaguire is fit for this one. Manchester United and Amorim should be thankful for that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7711jx6prko"}
