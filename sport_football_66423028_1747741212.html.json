But there was a five-minute delay in stoppage time - while Kyle Walker and Thomas Partey had treatment after a clash of heads - which was then added on at the end.\nMany games in the opening weekend of the EFL had similar amounts of injury time.\nGuardiola had spoken about the issue in the build-up to the Community Shield meeting too.\n\"Now, every game we're going to play for 100 minutes. Wasting time, from my point of view, it is not going to be solved by extending 10 more minutes,\" he said.\n\"It's more tiring for the players. It's too much.\"\nAnother new rule also caused a stir with Arsenal in the game.\nManagers and coaches \"must not confront, invade the personal space of, or make physical contact with the match officials\".\nAnd yellow cards will be issued to players delaying the restart of play or not retreating the necessary distance at a free-kick.\nArsenal's Partey and City's Julian Alvarez were both booked for kicking the ball away after the whistle was blown for a free-kick, while Arteta was shown a yellow card after asking for Rodri to be booked.\n\"We are going to get used to it,\" Arteta told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"It's very difficult to change habits straight away but that's the demands they are putting on us. We are going to have to train for it and be ready for it because, if not, we will be playing without 11 players and a manager on the touchline very often.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66423028"}
