Wales defended really hard. I remember us getting into the 22 and then either losing the ball, making a mistake or something going wrong.\n\"I was thinking 'gosh, I'm not sure how we're actually going to score in this game, but it's ok'. You kind of think that right up until the end, but it never actually came.\"\nWhile most would expect Wales' changing room to be bouncing after such a famous win, it was not the case.\n\"We were so tired because we had put such a massive defensive effort in, we were exhausted and sort of in a little bit of disbelief that we'd pulled it off,\" said Wales' Taylor.\n\"I think I said afterwards that it doesn't mean anything if we don't back this up. We beat Scotland and then we lost every game after that.\n\"But it's a really nice memory to have, the photos to look back on are really cool, because that squad was a really good bunch. You can see the passion and pure happiness on people's faces.\n\"We knew we had done something big in that moment.\"\nFor England's new caps, Tamara Taylor said it was a chastening introduction to Test rugby.\n\"They were excited but disappointed, it's their first cap â€“ there were a whole load of emotions going around,\" she said.\n\"Being able to see the elation from the Welsh group, knowing it's only the second time that they had beaten us and thinking could we have done any more?\n\"But as a rugby supporter and a coach I just think it must have been amazing to be in the Welsh changing room.\"\nRivalries will be renewed again this Saturday as Wales prepare to host England having not tasted victory since that fateful day in 2015.\nLast Six Nations, the Red Roses ran in eight tries in a 46-10 demolition of their neighbours, but Wales are hoping with new head coach Sean Lynn at the helm, this year will be more competitive as they seek to bounce back from an opening defeat by Scotland.\n\"I think there were some real improvements [against Scotland] on the weekend, especially like energy, want and desire,\" said Rachel Taylor.\n\"The big part to move forward will be defence. The worry is that we let Scotland have quite a lot of carry metres and England are renowned for that. Unless we can nullify that we could be in for a long afternoon.\n\"If we start really well, like we did against Scotland, and get on the board nice and early, use the Principality Stadium and that energy to get under their skin a little bit, that will have to be the narrative that we try and take.\"\nTamara Taylor said she hopes Wales and the other nations will eventually catch up with England after turning professional.\n\"I hope for women's rugby that the playing field will get levelled out,\" she said.\n\"There's a new coaching set up now with Wales. Sean Lynn has had very successful club campaigns so you hope he can take some of that magic into the Welsh group because there's a great group of players there.\n\"It's just probably about time together.\"\nAnd talking of time, Wales will be hoping they do not have to wait another 10 years to taste victory over the old enemy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c1jp6p90lgpo"}
