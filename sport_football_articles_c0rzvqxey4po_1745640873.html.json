His delivery is good, he scores goals. It was an opportunity for him against Brighton but he drifted out of the game.\n\"I don't know what the answer is. He wants to play left side but I think Gordon is always going to be the number one on that left side.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c0rzvqxey4po"}
