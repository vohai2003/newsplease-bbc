I would have gone for 1-1, but I am going to use his score instead.\nHe watches Forest every week so he is a proper fan, not someone who has jumped on the bandwagon like myself, so I will listen to him - although I may take legal action if he is wrong.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1we99y8598o"}
