And there's a four-week period to rehab after that.\"\nStevenage agreed to sell Thompson - who went off after only 18 minutes against Harrogate - after he rejected the offer of a new contract from the League One club.\nHe joined Boro in the summer of 2023 after previously playing for Swindon Town, Portsmouth and Peterborough United.\nMk Dons are 11th in League Two and are away to Doncaster Rovers on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx24ddzj3wqo"}
