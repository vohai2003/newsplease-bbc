I thought we did enough to win the match.\n\"I watched Celtic put on [Nicolas] Kuhn, [Arne] Engels, [Luis] Palma. I've asked Lyall Cameron to get off his sick bed to play, Finlay Robertson has not trained, [Cesar] Garza has had to come off.\n\"To put in that level of performance against that opposition is bordering on heroic.\n\"We made a Champions League team wobble. We sensed it, we went for it and gave everything to win that match. I thought my players deserved that tonight.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3w8q0d5nejo"}
