We have had all these promising players go out and it's not like they come back and do things for us but it's then they disappear.\n\"To have someone like [Ian] Poveda, [Charlie] Cresswell or [Cody] Drameh to do it properly by going out to get experience and then coming back as valuable assets for us. It would be great, wouldn't it?\"\nSports editor Jonny Buchan: \"They have been the victim of the club's success.
