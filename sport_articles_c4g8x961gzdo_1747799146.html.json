Never looked like scoring. Team selection and substitutes yet again leaves me baffled. It's as if Don Cowie picks them to give them a game to keep them all happy. Ronan Hale might get a start next week as he had two shots on goal at the end!\nAlistair: I am utterly fed up watching a team that appears to have no shape, no cohesion, and has players that just punt and chase directionless long balls up the park. We have players who actually do have talent but don't seem to have any idea what is required of them and certainly don't look like they are going to drag themselves out of a self-inflicted mess that leads to relegation unless the brakes are applied. Another home game where we have absolutely no effect in front of the opponent's goal. One shot in the 94th minute and it went wide. I don't know if I want to see much more of this. Cowie's assessment of games shows he and I watch different matches.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g8x961gzdo"}
