It was like he knew.\nThe only chances St Johnstone had up until that point had been a long-range strike from Graham Carey, that was immediately followed by Makenzie Kirk's header.\nSt Mirren's defending had all come from the front as Mikael Mandron and Toyosi Olusanya pressed and pressed, and while they did force chances and looked dangerous on the counter, the final ball was desperately lacking.\nThat's now three home games on the spin that have ended in defeat - to Dundee, Dundee United, and now St Johnstone.\nWith the league this tight, they need to address their home form quickly or else they'll keep sliding down the way.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cre82qxdjp8o"}
