However, Benteke was well placed to give Palace a 57th-minute lead after excellent work by Loftus-Cheek but somehow hammered the ball over the bar. It was a huge let-off for Liverpool.\nCrystal Palace manager Frank de Boer:\n\"We were quite concentrated for almost all of the match. I saw a team who wants to fight for each other. It could be a draw, a Liverpool win or the other way - with our two chances it could have been different.\n\"A lot of times they were frustrated because we played very organised.\n\"Today this was the best tactic to get the result, but the coin could have fallen the other way.\"\nLiverpool will now look to finish off the job against Hoffenheim and secure a place in the Champions League group stage. The Reds lead the Bundesliga club 2-1 going into Wednesday's deciding play-off leg at Anfield (19:45 BST).\nPalace are also in midweek cup action. They entertain Ipswich Town in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday (19:30 BST).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40908329"}
