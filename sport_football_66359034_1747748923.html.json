I feel a lot of confidence in my own game and I've been consistent off the back of the Euros.\n\"I'm just trying to keep that momentum. I feel I've proven my leadership in the way that I play and lead by example. I'm not afraid to communicate as well so I'll try and do the two jobs.\"\nShe said Walsh had been \"the best teacher without knowing it\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66359034"}
