We tried in many different ways. We insisted but lacked that spark, that final pass to unlock a well organised team. We have to generate more shots on target.\n\"Very different standard [to the West Ham defeat]. We defended with energy, purpose, fight, willingness to make things happen. It wasn't because we lacked that. We tried until the end but weren't able to do it.\"\nOn their lack of strikers: \"Same as before. It's what we have. We look forward to working with what we have.\"\nOn the title: \"It was same a week ago, two weeks ago, three months ago. The only thing we can do is win our matches and see how many points we get.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvg11e7r5v2o"}
