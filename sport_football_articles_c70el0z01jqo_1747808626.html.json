The manager has them well-drilled but I'm happy our team has come away with the three points.\"\nOn his goal celebration: \"A week ago I had my first child, so I said I would do that if I scored. I'm happy I was able to do that.\"\nOn being picked to play: \"It is just about being ready. We have some players in top form so it is hard for the manager to leave some players out and I understand that. It is just about being ready and getting consistent minutes behind me.\n\"We created some great chances at the end. The goals will come for Ollie Watkins. We will always create chances, just in the second half of this season we need to be more ruthless in front of goal.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70el0z01jqo"}
