Glimpses of 2022-23 season with Gabriel Martinelli proactively creating chances and a great assist to put Bukayo Saka on the scoresheet. Shaky defence in the final 10 minutes. This week's matches are crucial to set up a good team against Real Madrid, who just got themselves into a cup final. Injuries do not help. Mikel Arteta has a lot to think about.\nHamza: Good result and some decent performances but shocking how Jurrien Timber wasn't subbed at half-time. Just unnecessary and poor management especially as we have Real Madrid next week.\nBob: As good a full-back as Myles Lewis-Skelly is, this is not for the first time he's lost who he was supposed to be marking. Good to see Gabriel Martinelli back to his old self. I made him player of the match.\nMichael: More injures, which may not be serious, but it has been said that Arsenal now have four injured defenders. Well, don't forget Takehiro Tomiyasu who has barely played a game this season. I really rate him, and that makes FIVE injured defenders!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj3xmmpmzlvo"}
