He improved the league. He was on the wrong side of Manchester so I wish him good luck. It was a pleasure to see him in Portugal a lot of times.\"\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who worked with De Bruyne at City: \"I rank him up there. He is one of the best players in the Premier League. [I've] never seen a player that can deliver that precisely at that high speed.\"\nBrentford manager Thomas Frank: \"I can only praise him. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League ever. There are a few good ones, eh? But from the more central, offensive players like Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard - iconic England ones - I think De Bruyne is up there.\"\nIpswich manager Kieran McKenna: \"He's been incredible and certainly one of the greatest to grace the league. We faced him quite a few times when I was a coach with United and at that time, the biggest part of the gameplan was how to stop him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpdzn9v2769o"}
