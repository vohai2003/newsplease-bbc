The manager looked relieved, his emotions no doubt swinging like a pendulum during a game that saw the best of his Celtic side, but also a profligacy that almost cost them.\nThe first half was brilliant. Young Boys tried to play in a compact shape with a high defensive line. Brave? Perhaps. Naive? It seemed so.\nCeltic cut them open time and again to create chance after chance. Nicolas Kuhn missed a couple of good openings and was a little hesitant to pull the trigger.\nThe disallowed goals might be considered unlucky, but the penalty miss from Engels - his first after six successful spot-kicks - was an incredible fourth let-off, the accumulation of which allowed Young Boys to believe.\nThe second half was a sloppy affair. Passes started to go astray. Young Boys got higher and higher up the pitch and only superb Schmeichel saves prevented Celtic from going behind.\nThey dug out the moment of quality in the end as under-fire Idah latched on to Hatate's phenomenal through ball and forced a save that ended with Benito turning the ball into his own net.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn01g9n5y89o"}
