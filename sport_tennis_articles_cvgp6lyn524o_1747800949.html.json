I love competition,\" Djokovic said when asked about the milestone.\n\"I try to give my best every single time. It's been over 20 years that I've been competing in Grand Slams at the highest level.\n\"Whether I win or lose, I will always leave my heart out on the court. I'm just blessed to be making another record.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cvgp6lyn524o"}
