You couldn’t meet a better guy.\n“It’s great to be a part of that and I’m delighted to have spent the time with him, and still continue to do so. I can’t pay him any more credit, he’s just such a terrific person.\n“With the number of appearances he’s made and what he has achieved at Celtic, it is up there with the very best, and he has written his name in history, and long may that continue.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cmj44p0egvro"}
