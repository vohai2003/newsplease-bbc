It's not just the starting XI, it's the whole squad fighting for places,\" said Fulham captain Antonee Robinson to BBC Match of the Day.\n\"The fact everyone keeps the belief and there's so much contribution from the bench just shows we're together as unit and working for each other.\"\nMarco Silva was spot on with his changes once again as he took off Raul Jimenez - who scored the equaliser - for Rodrigo Muniz late on.\nMuniz's goal gave Fulham their first league win at St James' Park in 16 years to lift them up to ninth, just five points adrift of Newcastle in fifth as they continue on their charge for a spot in Europe.\nIt is almost 14 years since Fulham, under the guidance of Roy Hodgson, went all the way to the Europa League final - where they were beaten by Atletico Madrid.\nBut, Fulham fans may have eyes on yet another European tour next season.\nSilva's side did not accept defeat today despite staring it in the face after a dismal first half display and were rewarded for their almighty efforts with all three points.\nUp next for Silva's men in the Premier League is a home tie against high-flying Nottingham Forest but Fulham will be full confidence heading into that one.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg8x51q98do"}
