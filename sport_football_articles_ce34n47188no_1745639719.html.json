He's made his bed, and it's an uncomfortable bed to lie in.\n\"His formation at the minute doesn't provide us with hardly any good football. We've not scored a goal in the first half from open play for 17 games.\n\"We're not breaking through defences. We need set pieces and we need one-off moments of magic like Bruno Fernandes gives us.\n\"I see some of the players we have and I think we've actually got some talent. But this season is just a sacrifice now.\n\"As Man Utd fans, what do we do? What are we supporting this team for if the whole season is sacrificed?\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce34n47188no"}
