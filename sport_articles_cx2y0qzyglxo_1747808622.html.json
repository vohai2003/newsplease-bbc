Hearts' Neil Critchley has five wins from 15 while David Gray at Hibernian has only recently pushed his win percentage in to the high 20s.\nAgain, it's tight in the Scottish top flight but that also means a win can go a long way and Valakari still has it within his gift to guide St Johnstone off the bottom of the table in time for the New Year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2y0qzyglxo"}
