No more international breaks and, clearly, no European distractions either.\nIn a sense, Guardiola has delivered his verdict on the campaign as a whole by declaring neither he, his coaches, nor his players, deserve a bonus this season, even if they win the Club World Cup in the summer.\nHowever, the opportunity is still there to win the FA Cup - which would bring his tally to three and City's to eight (only Arsenal and Manchester United have won it more than that) - and qualify for next season's Champions League, which is an imperative.\nIf City can accomplish that, it might not be as good as winning a title or a European Cup, but it would be an acceptable conclusion by virtually any measure - other than their own high standards.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyjynnzkxwo"}
