I don't want to have one week off without a game. I just want to keep playing, because before I wasn't playing. Now that I'm playing and I feel that I'm getting better and better, I want to test myself.\n\"The team is helping me a lot. They're trying to find me. I can see they trust me. They trust in my strength and I just want to pay back the trust they put on me.\"\nWhen asked if this is the best he has felt in his playing career, Beto added: \"Almost. I've felt this type of way in Udinese, in Italy, and I'm starting to feel it now in Everton and I'm happy for the team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ckgdy5r0nv2o"}
