We came to win and that's what we did.\n\"The Champions League is the main goal. We'll focus on Saturday, another big one for us.\n\"I thought defensively we were excellent. All 11 of us stuck together. I didn't feel threatened at all. We managed to get them on the counter-attack a few times and we got a few goals.\n\"It was the desire from everyone. We've kept a few clean sheets in a row. In the last few games we've shown we can do it.\nOn goalscorer Marcus Rashford: \"He's got a smile on his face again. He looks like he's enjoying football again. I'm so pleased for him.\n\"We have to take it game by game. Now it's all eyes on Saturday.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0789pxgpkpo"}
