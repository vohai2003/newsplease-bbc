LSG approached me first so I had to give them preference.\n\"[Lucknow mentor] Zaheer Khan had called me when I was playing in the Ranji Trophy and he told me that you may be called in as a potential replacement so don't switch yourself off.\n\"Ups and downs are a part of life. I have always backed my skills.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/clyjw5q8e14o"}
