We were brilliant from start to end; really good going forward, creating chances, scoring goals. Unfortunately we conceded one goal but it was a top performance.\nOn what has been worked on in the past few days: \"Not too much. We work hard every day and especially after performances like West Ham and Forest. We've been working on a lot of finishing but the same as always. We always work hard. Tonight, it all clicked. We've had a bit extra focus on it [finishing] after the past few games. We know we have quality. We created so much, so it was good to get everything out.\"\nOn scoring more goals himself: \"Every player in my position want to influence the game with goals and assists and it's something I haven't been good enough at this season, but two goals and one assist tonight is a good step.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c3rn9jgjv32o"}
