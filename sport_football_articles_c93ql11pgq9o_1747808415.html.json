The game was over at the break.\nA team which has been built on solid foundations, just nine goals against in 28 games so far. Solid foundations and the rest will follow, at least that's the theory. Tonight it was, empathically.\nRuthless in front of goal, the gulf between the two sides was stark.\nUnlike the gulf between the top four, there is currently nothing in it.\nThe top four have all won in this midweek round of fixtures.\nPerhaps its points against each other that might be the difference between finishing in the top two, and missing out.\nIt's Leeds United next for Burnley on Monday night.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93ql11pgq9o"}
