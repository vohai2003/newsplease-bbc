Injuries and the red card were not helpful in the start but it's all good. They all are a threat, they all are good footballers - the ticket into the team will be the readiness for defence because you never hear about a team being really successful with sloppy defending, it just will not happen.\n\"For Darwin [it's] the same like for all the other strikers as well because I know about the quality they have and they need to do both, like our other players have to do both as well - defend and being influential in all the offensive situations.\"\nNunez scored nine league goals after joining the Reds from Benfica for an initial Â£64m and Klopp says the 24-year-old was a \"handful\" against the Foxes.\nKlopp added: \"It's good, you can see he is a handful, the speed and the goal was a typical goalscorer's goal. Being there, smelling it and finishing it off. In training he looks really good. He is fit, that helps, and now two more games and Chelsea.\"\nLiverpool end their tour of Asia with a friendly against Bayern Munich in Singapore on Wednesday, while Leicester return home to host local rivals Coventry City in their opening Championship game on 6 August.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66355042"}
