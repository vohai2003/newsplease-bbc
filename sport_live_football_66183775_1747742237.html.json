I don't know how we managed to stay in this game.\n\"We didn't play our best game, but in some way we showed we're hard-headed, we showed heart, we never give up. We took it to extra time, we took it to penalties and we managed to win.\"\n'Soccer can be cruel'\nUSA coach Vlatko Andonovski: \" I know we were criticised for the way we played ... I think we came out today and were all about the grit, the resilience.\n\"Unfortunately, soccer can be cruel sometimes.

Or maybe finally an African country will win a senior World Cup.\n'Penalties suck'\nUSA captain Lindsey Horan: \"A lot went into this performance, we were confident and patient and played beautiful football.

The underdog going into the match pulls away with the win through their tough work and perseverance, truly incredible.\nBrian: This whole tournament has felt very 'end of an era' for the USWNT. Just about a scraped through the groups with 3 ok/poor performances and couldn't kill off a game they dominated today.
