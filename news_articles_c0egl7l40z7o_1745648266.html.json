We need effective leadership.\"\nIt heralds a potential political comeback in this year's election for the Democrat, who quit in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations and scrutiny of his handling of the Covid pandemic.\nAmerica's most populous city is in a state of political turmoil as current Mayor Eric Adams denies claims he struck a deal to help the Trump administration with migrant raids in exchange for dropping a federal corruption case against him.\nThe former governor joins an already crowded contest, which includes lawmakers, young newcomers and Mayor Adams himself, though it is Cuomo who has the most name recognition.\nThe three-term governor resigned after an investigation found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.\nThe state-led inquiry determined he had made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped the women and kissed them without consent.\nAt the time, President Joe Biden led calls from Democrats for the embattled Cuomo to step down, and state lawmakers raised the prospect of impeachment.\nWhen the governor left office, he denied harassing anyone, but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who might have been offended by his actions.\nCuomo's stunning downfall happened a year after he basked in the adulation of millions of Americans who had tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut a report in 2022 found that under his administration, the state hid at least 4,100 Covid-related nursing home deaths from the public.\nCuomo admitted to a \"delay\" in reporting, but denied allegations that his administration purposely misled New Yorkers.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigns in wake of harassment report\nChris Cuomo: CNN fires presenter over help he gave politician brother\nAndrew Cuomo accuser: New York governor 'groped me'\nOpinion polling by New York media in recent weeks has projected that Cuomo would become frontrunner if he entered the mayoral race.\nDays before the campaign was launched, Cuomo received the surprise backing of congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx.\n\"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics - both from the far left and far right,\" he told the New York Post.\n\"We don't need a Mr Nice Guy. We need a Mr Tough Guy.\"\nCuomo's supporters have also launched a political action committee called Fix the City, which states it aims to raise $15m (Â£12m) for his campaign war chest.\nOne of Cuomo's former aides who accused him of sexual harassment told the New York Post, external on Saturday that she fears women's rights will suffer if he wins election.\n\"New York City may elect a mayor who has been rightfully accused of sexual misconduct by several young women who worked for him in up-close positions,\" said Karen Hinton.\n\"As a movement, we women haven't done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical, and what should be illegal behaviour by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo.\"\nThe Democratic primary vote will take place in June.
