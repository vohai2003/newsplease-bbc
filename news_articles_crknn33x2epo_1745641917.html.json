Now is the time to take action.\"\nHazel Stokes, a resident, said she walks this route a couple of times a week to shop at the retail park, along with mums with prams, cyclists, and pedestrians who are all affected.\nShe said: \"You're walking in pigeon poo, and everything that's thrown up from the road, it's absolutely disgusting, and it's been this way for years.\"\nBarbara Waller, another resident, said she'd contacted Network Rail years ago to tell them it was \"dangerous\" and \"horrible for people walking along there\".\nShe added her two daughters \"take their shoes off and wash their trolleys before they can come back into the house, it's absolutely disgusting\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crknn33x2epo"}
