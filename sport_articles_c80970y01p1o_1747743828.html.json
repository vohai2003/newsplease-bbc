Maresca confirmed the defender will be missing for the \"next games\" but didn't give a timeframe for his return.\nThe new club captain is yet to be decided, when asked about who it might be: \"Jamie [Vardy], Albrighton, Coady and Ricardo Pereira, they are all leaders even if they donâ€™t wear the armband.\"\nOn the possibility of more players coming in: \"The market is still open, anything can happen.\"\nMore departures are expected before the end of the summer transfer window as the club has \"too many players\". Harry Souttar could be one of those players, \"something could happen\" said Maresca.\nMain focus is on the Championship task, as winning the Premier League and FA Cup is \"history and if we think about the past it will be a big mistake.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c80970y01p1o"}
