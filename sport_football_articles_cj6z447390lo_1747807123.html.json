First half, we were not at the races and I made some changes. I thought we had a stronger performance second half and we asked some questions.\n\"Taking our chances has been a challenge since I have been at the club. It still is and was today in those key areas, where people are trying to pass it rather than shoot.\n\"You look at the goalscoring records before I was here, it has been an ongoing challenge. I don't know whether you have noticed, but the players that are able to do that cost a lot of money.\n\"You have to develop a way of playing but, equally, it comes down to individuals when the moment of truth comes.\"\nOn Armando Broja's injury: \"We will have to wait and see on Armando. He has caught the floor as he has gone to shoot and twisted himself.\n\"Jesper Lindstrom picked up a knock as well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj6z447390lo"}
