Neither could be viewed as being likely to oust Gabriel Jesus as Arsenal’s preferred number nine.\nHowever, Jesus missed a chunk of last season through injury and there have been similar issues – maybe not quite as severe – in previous campaigns as well.\nI would be surprised if Mikel Arteta let both forwards leave without having a replacement. The whole point of this summer has been to improve what he already has, both numerically and through quality.\nAnd frontline strikers better than Arsenal already have are rare - and expensive.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cv2jjv5jm23o"}
