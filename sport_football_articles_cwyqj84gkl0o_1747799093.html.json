We were a bit sloppy with the ball in the second half. There's stuff to improve on but it's a victory with three goals, so it's positive. We looked threatening every time we went forward in the first half.\"\nOn Brennan Johnson's performance: \"You want as many players in good form. Brennan is always a threat whenever he plays. He was really good today. He is always a goal threat.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyqj84gkl0o"}
