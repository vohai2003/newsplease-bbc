Assuming he continues to perform well at Villa, would you try to welcome him back/discuss ideas with him, or has that ship now sailed?\nPhil answered: Hello, Rob. This is a really interesting question. Rashford has done well at Aston Villa and looked much more like his old self, but I believe Ruben Amorim has looked at Rashford, on and off the pitch, and decided he is not for him.\nHe made that pretty clear. There is always room for discussion when his Villa loan spell ends but, based on what Amorim has said publicly about Rashford, I do not see any way those bridges can be rebuilt.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdxny734v66o"}
