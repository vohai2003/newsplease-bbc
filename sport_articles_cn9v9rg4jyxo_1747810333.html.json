Sadly for manager Tony Docherty, that is not a positive thing for him most of the time.\nOnly Celtic and Rangers have scored more Premiership goals than Dundee this term, but they have shipped a league high of 67. Bottom side St Johnstone have conceded 10 fewer.\nThe front three of Simon Murray, Scott Tiffoney and Oluwaseun Adewumi are good enough to have Dundee comfortably in the top half, but defensive issues continue to plague Docherty's men.\nIf that is not addressed in the final stretch of league games, the Dens Park side could find themselves in real trouble.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn9v9rg4jyxo"}
