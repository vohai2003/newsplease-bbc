Lots of movement, crisp passing, attacking threat. Conceding three goals was a concern so still some tightening up at the back to do, but if Unai Emery can sort that out then there is plenty to be optimistic about for the coming season.\nJason: A new second keeper is desperately needed. I didn't think we would get worse than the wonder that was Orjan Nyland, and yet here we are. If Emi Martinez picks up an injury or suspension, we're in serious trouble.\nDavid: Although some players are still out injured, we clearly lacked depth. Definitely need a better back-up keeper. Robin Olsen is a liability and we need cover at right-back. Ollie Watkins is our sole goalscorer so we need other options for when he is off form or injured etc.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4nwzk8n0w9o"}
