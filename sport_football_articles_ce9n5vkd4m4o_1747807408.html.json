We gave away two dreadful goals. I'm pleased with the way they responded in the second half. I'm pleased with the subs, they all had an impact.\n\"We hit the post three times, had one cleared off line. It just wasn't our day. We just needed one of the chances to go for us and it didn't.\"\nCould it be a blessing in disguise to focus on the league? \"Maybe. The most important thing for us is to make sure we're a Premier League club. It would have been nice to get to a cup final - it wasn't like we gave it up.\n\"Now our focus is totally back on the Premier League and trying to do what we need to do.\n\"Goodison is somewhere I've gotten very used to over the years. There will be people who know Goodison more than I'll ever know. A special stadium. On its day it can have an incredible atmosphere and be intimidating. We're hoping the new stadium will give us all that. But before we talk about the new stadium we have to make sure we're a Premier League club.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce9n5vkd4m4o"}
