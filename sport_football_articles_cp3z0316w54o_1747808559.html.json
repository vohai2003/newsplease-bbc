Especially in the first half, I had a good chance, we had a few others and then we conceded a deflected goal.\n\"We tried to compete - and we did - but the result is not good.\n\"We have suffered a few big defeats. We have one way which we are building in training, which we wanted to show. In many ways we did, but we have to try not to concede goals.\n\"Jarrod [Bowen] is a big miss for us. This season he has been great, but this is football and we need to step up for him now.\n\"We showed more with the ball and we had chances but we need to concentrate on getting points.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp3z0316w54o"}
