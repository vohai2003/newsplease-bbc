The England international laughed at the Brighton defender lying on the ground – before seeing the red card come out.\nTo make matters worse, the incident happened after Alexander Isak was in an offside position so nothing that happened would have counted – except violent conduct.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cd7egexd8r8o"}
