The constant drama and chaos at Chelsea has meant that little attention has been paid to it by most fans.\nBut now it is getting close, it is becoming clear how big a deal this is. What initially seemed like it would be nothing more than a series of friendlies tacked on to the end of the season has taken on huge importance.\nThe prize money on offer is massive, which means the clubs are taking it seriously. The fact the clubs are taking it seriously in turn makes it more prestigious.\nFor Chelsea, who had the embarrassment of being out of Europe last season entirely followed by the almost equal shame of playing in the Conference League this season, it means a chance to face top teams in a competitive tournament.\nWhile reaching the Champions League through their league position remains priority number one for Enzo Maresca, the Club World Cup is taking on greater and greater importance, and is turning from an odd boondoggle into the climax of the season.\nThe \"exceptional transfer window\" which will open before the tournament starts has made it even more interesting. It has become a pre-season and a post-season rolled into one.\nSome very exciting new signings will now see competitive action just weeks after our final league games of this season. Instead of waiting until August to see the shiny new toys in meaningful action, fans get to see them in June.\nIt has prompted the club to do a lot of early business already, and their plans for the summer to follow the tournament are likely to be heavily affected by performances and results in the USA.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp34w521gp9o"}
