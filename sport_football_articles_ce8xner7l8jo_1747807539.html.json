Ten Hag was expected to lose his job, and you'd likely be able to count the number of the world's punters who backed United on one hand.\nTwo academy graduates - Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - netting the decisive goals in a 2-1 victory made the occasion all the more sweet.\nRich traditions overcoming modern, state-backed dominance. Days like that sunny afternoon in May are the ones that Manchester United Football Club is all about.\nTears were flowing (and not just from my eyes) as I stood in the heavens at Wembley in disbelief. Dread quickly transitioned into immense pride.\nVengeance for that agonising narrow defeat in the first-ever Manchester derby FA Cup final a year earlier.\nIt just went to show that no matter how bad things stoop at this incredible football club, there will always be a chance of magic.\nAt the start of the sixth rebuild since the days of Sir Alex Ferguson, that sparks desperately needed hope under Ruben Amorim.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8xner7l8jo"}
