Everyone looked like they wanted something to prove. Two very clean strikes from Dominic Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. And just give Mohamed Salah his new contract - every time he delivers a cross with the outside of his boot is an extra Â£10,000 add-on bonus in waiting!\nDavid: This was the best-looking performance of the season. Fluid and intense. They look like champions all the way through.\nStuart: Once it was apparent Alexander Isak wasn't playing, Liverpool nullified Newcastle with ease. They worked the ball so well and hardly broke a sweat. Salah smiled the entire game. Every player glided around the pitch. Once the Arsenal result filtered through to the players, they were very professional and closed the game out.\nNewcastle fans\nKrish: When you play at Anfield you need to take chances or make the keeper work and we couldn't do that. We limited Liverpool to only a few chances but there's a clear divide in quality without Isak, Joelinton and Sven Botman. We need positive performances ahead of the final\nRobert: Sadly it's going to be more than 70 years of winning a trophy in this country for Newcastle United. It seemed like men against boys.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c20dddl1g63o"}
