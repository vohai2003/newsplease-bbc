Quite the opposite in fact, now their focus is just on the Premier League.\nThe Reds also felt wronged by Everton's late equaliser at Goodison Park in February so there will be all of that bubbling under, and Arne Slot's side will feel they have a point to prove.\nThey are going to put Everton under all sorts of pressure, but the Toffees will be well organised defensively and have an eye on a counter-attack too.\nEverton boss David Moyes has transformed a team that was lacking belief, and he would love nothing more than to go to Anfield and get something.\nI am expecting a typical derby, in that I would not be surprised if this is another emotional game as well as an explosive one, with maybe a couple of players losing their heads.\nThere will be plenty of drama along the way, but I am pretty sure Liverpool will be back to their best form and end up taking the three points.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62x57y8pv3o"}
