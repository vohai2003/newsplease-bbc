We can go long into him, he picks up second balls, a threat in the box. For the first time he has played 45 minutes for us in a very long time so that's pleasing.\"\nIf Fullkrug can stay fit, he could have a fruitful end to the campaign.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g2r1x4d3ko"}
