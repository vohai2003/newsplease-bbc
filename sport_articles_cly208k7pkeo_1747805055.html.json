They have been in the treatment room, but now they are on the training pitch.\"\nSt Mirren will be a \"difficult\" opponent and are a team with \"an identity\" but Docherty says Dundee \"are a good side with a real identity\".\nLyall Cameron and Scott Fraser are the only absentees this weekend.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cly208k7pkeo"}
