He doesn't speak often, but when he does speak, he captures the room,\" said Tiatia.\n\"I like Harri, he's a tough competitor, a tough loose forward who gets his head in the hole and doesn't mind getting his nose smacked and broken.\n\"That's the type of player I like.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/articles/c5y4ev717q2o"}
