Guardiola's worst-case seven weeks would be the final game of the season at Fulham on 25 May.\nIntriguingly, in the middle of those two matches is the FA Cup final.\nNottingham Forest will argue against whether City will even be at Wembley to face Aston Villa or Crystal Palace in the showpiece. However, it is a target for Haaland, whose absence surely means Mohamed Salah will be crowned the Premier League's Golden Boot winner.\nHaaland will also have a couple of internationals for Norway at the beginning of June to make sure he is fully fit for the Club World Cup.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yr3g5x407o"}
