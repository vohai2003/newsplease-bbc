I also didn't think for one second the referee was going to give a penalty [for the first goal] and then he did. It is what it is.\n\"Let's have it right, they've thrown themselves to the floor, they've fouled us, kicked us, and we've had nothing.\n\"It's all the dark arts, they've got experienced players in the other side of the game and it's old school football.\"\nRobins' comments throw up a number of questions and we want to know what you think of his claims:\nWere Stoke bullied by Portsmouth?\nDid the decisions go against the Potters?\nDo you agree with Robins that Pompey deployed the 'dark arts'?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9qj0r2el4xo"}
