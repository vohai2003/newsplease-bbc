It was a very good first 30 minutes from us, but you cannot concede a goal in that way. We should have done much better in that moment.\n\"Second half, we changed. We made another mistake which gave them another penalty. If we keep doing this then it is more difficult to win matches.\n\"We should have won the game because we did more than them. When on front foot, we should have killed them in the right way.\"\nOn whether Leif Davis should have been sent off in the first half: \"It is important to say that discussions with the referee are normal. It's difficult to understand why it wasn't a red card.\n\"It's just emotions, just normal. It's my job to be as calm as I can.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1elx3w32jpo"}
