There's still belief, a lot of togetherness and you can see that as a team so it was a good night for us.\n\"We're coming into the last quarter of the season and we want to finish off the season well and make it our best quarter and get as many points as we can and where that leaves us, let's see.\n\"The second goal was a fantastic move and for me the best goal anyone has scored here this year as they are really hard to play through.\"\nOn Saturday's home match against Wolves: \"It's a big game, no doubt about it. It's a big game to look forward to, a big game, a pressure game so let's attack it. We try to enjoy every game at Portman Road.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c14xlkjg534o"}
