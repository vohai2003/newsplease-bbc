I think we were in control of the game, but they found a way with Cunha - an amazing goal. We should have scored two or three goals today.\n\"VAR, waiting seven minutes, it could have easily been 3-0 but we don't punish them when we are playing better. We were controlling the whole game. We deserved to go to the next round, but we had to do it in a difficult way.\"\nOn VAR and semi-automated offsides: \"In the first game we need it, it goes against us. It doesn't work. They had to draw the lines and we were waiting seven minutes. It is definitely not a good sign for everyone involved.\n\"I remember in the Carabao Cup we went out because they scored with an arm and there was no VAR. I think everything has gone against us today but, fortunately for us, we go into the next round.\n\"We should have won this game a lot earlier, we missed big chances. In extra-time, I don't think they even arrived to our box.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvg1n3e7v70o"}
