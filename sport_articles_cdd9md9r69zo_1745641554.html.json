Jim Goodwin and the boys can get over the line but nothing less than 100% effort and focus is required for remaining games!\nKieran: Architects of our downfall. First half was up there as one of the best of the season. Second half the team was non-existent. We have should gone in for the kill for a third goal.\nIf Aberdeen were more sharp in the box, this game could well have been lost. Massive game in two weeks at home. Three points is a must, anything less and top six could be out of reach.\nRoger: The second half performance from United was pathetic and we got what we deserved. You can't sit back and accept that amount of pressure without it eventually telling. The inevitable happened and Aberdeen deserved at least a point. Goodwin did nothing to stop the momentum either. Really, really poor show guys.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cdd9md9r69zo"}
