I think we have to be proud of the defensive performance - the lads left it all out there and that's all you can ask.\"\nThe Preston draw came on the back of a resounding win over Blackburn Rovers in their first game after the departure of head coach Luke Williams.\nSwansea are 16th in the table, 10 points clear of the Championship relegation zone with 11 games remaining this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cz9nk4x85xgo"}
