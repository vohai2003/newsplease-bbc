If you have any of these disabled, the accuracy of your location may be affected.\nThe BBC Weather app uses the location provided by your device to determine the closest forecast information available. If the location displayed in the app is incorrect, check other apps on your device, e.g. iOS Maps or Google Maps, to identify where your device thinks you are located.\nIf the location chosen by your device is incorrect, please refer to the Android and iOS guides below:-\nThe app checks for the latest forecast information as soon as you launch it. The time (and date, if applicable) of the last update is displayed, so that you can determine how recent the forecast information is.\nThe app also allows you to add a BBC Weather 'widget' to your home screen. On Android, the widget will periodically check for the latest forecast information based on the frequency you set within the app: 'Settings' > 'Widget Refresh Frequency'. On iOS, the operating system decides how often to refresh the data based on your daily usage pattern.\nWhile you can store the BBC Weather app on your Android device's SD card, widgets will not be available if you choose to do so. This is a limitation of the Android operating system. If you cannot see any widgets in your list of available widgets, access the Android's 'Settings' Menu > Manage Applications > BBC Weather. From here, you can move the BBC Weather app from your SD card to the phone/tablet's memory. You should then restart your device to enable the BBC Weather widgets.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/about/24085989"}
