Workers were urged to \"make fruits cascade down\" and create a \"socialist fairyland\".\nWives were told to be dependable, while \"sports games [are] to be played in an offensive way\", the slogans said.\nThe isolated country widely uses propaganda to maintain the power of its leader Kim Jong-un.\nSeveral slogans made threats against what North Korea called its enemies. Slogans described the US as \"warmongers\" and said North Korea would \"annihilate them to the last man\" if they invaded.\nFood production also featured extensively in the slogans. Workers were encouraged to fill the country \"with the fragrant smell of fish\" and told that \"fertiliser means rice and socialism\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31438061"}
