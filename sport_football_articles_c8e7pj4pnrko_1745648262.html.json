I feel like everyone's legs started to go after 90 minutes. It went to penalties and luckily we won - I'm grateful.\n\"I feel like we could have done it in 90 minutes, but the most important thing is that we got the win and we are into the next round.\n\"I think as a group we need to be a bit more clinical, and then maybe we would be higher in the table.\n\"I think for now we have got the win and we will see who we get tomorrow.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c8e7pj4pnrko"}
