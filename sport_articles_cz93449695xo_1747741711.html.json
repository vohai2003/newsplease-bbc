We are still light in a few positions, with full-back and midfield a slight concern for the opening fixture. Andoni will have to work out who can fill those gaps before any new arrivals come in.\nHe will also be looking to implement a new style as quickly as possible.\nWe had a very pragmatic approach last season, whereas Andoniâ€™s philosophy has often been described as chaotic and 'rock-and-roll football', so it may take time for the group to adapt to that.\nWith a few key injuries in the squad, predicting the opening day lineup is tricky but I would expect us to go with a 4-2-3-1 system this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz93449695xo"}
