We didn’t start the game well and County made it really difficult for us.\n\"Once we found our space and combinations we scored a couple of really good goals and played some fantastic football. The two goals we gave away are soft.\"\nOn David Turnbull's performance: \"He’s got that quality and ability. I can only assess form what I’ve seen, he’s been excellent in training and in the games.\n\"What I do for players is create an environment. He’ll determine how far he goes. He’s at an age now where he can take that on he can become a very, very important player for us. Hopefully this is a nice confidence boost for him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cw0n2nx89kxo"}
