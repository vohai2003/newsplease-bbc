We went out there to provide surgery to people out there who otherwise probably couldn't afford the procedure,\" Mr Sian said.\n\"We did our very best to give all the patients good outcomes, and it was great to see them over the next few days for their follow-ups, as we could track the level of improvement the treatment had made for them â€“ they were so grateful.\"\nMr Sian said he hopes to go out to India and Sri Lanka next, and is talking about possibly going to Syria.\nHe added that work back home in Somerset is \"very busy but fun\".\n\"It's a lovely job,\" Mr Sian said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14jjk5zj2zo"}
