They never take it for granted.\nOf course, if they qualify they can still be disappointed that they haven't defended their title, but at least they have finished the season in a positive manner.\nThey are also still in the FA Cup, so I am in no doubt that they will want to have a say in where that trophy goes this season after losing out to Manchester United last time round.\nSo yes, their Champions League and Premier League campaign has gone but it isn't all doom and gloom.\nThe focus just needs to be on recovering players, bedding in the new ones, and getting the team back to playing the football the manager knows they are capable of.\nHopefully, that will all then lead to comfortable Champions League qualification and a place in the FA Cup final.\nBut in contrast, if they don't finish the season well and there is then a high player turnover in the summer, it will create another challenge.\nThere are current players who have been instrumental to the last decade's success, so you don't want to be in a position where those important players are told to move on based on this campaign's performances.\nLeaving a club is undoubtedly the nature of football, but if a season ends badly in terms of results and performances, then it can be a downer on how they look at some of the icons of the club.\nThe 'older' players are still good enough, but if they are not playing well, or they are injured and their energy is not the same, then you do wonder what the next season for Manchester City is going to look like.\nThere is going to be change this summer, but unfortunately at the minute it feels like it will be justified on the performances of this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c9vyygjlml3o"}
