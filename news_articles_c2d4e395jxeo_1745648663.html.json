The biggest is whether President Trump would keep the promise his predecessor Harry Truman made in 1949 to treat an attack on a Nato ally as an attack on America.\nThose concerns are based on what appears to be Trump's determination to restore a strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe has put heavy pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin big concessions - that would have to be made by the Ukrainians.\nThe security of Ukraine is coming a poor second - and Europeans are worrying theirs is too.\nPresident Zelensky's refusal to make those concessions has infuriated Trump.\nIt's not just the minerals deal that he refused to sign. Ukrainians believe they are in a war for national survival - and that Putin would break any promise to end the war if he is not deterred.\nThat's why Zelensky asked repeatedly for American security guarantees.\nThe meeting ignited into a shouting match after an intervention by Vice-President JD Vance.\nThere are suspicions now that the public row was - in the words of one diplomatic observer - a planned political mugging: either to force Zelensky to do America's bidding, or to precipitate a crisis that would allow them to blame him for whatever happens next.\nIf Trump follows the breakdown of talks with a freeze on military aid, Ukraine will fight on. The questions are how effectively, and for how long.\nPressure will redouble on its European allies to take up the slack.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2d4e395jxeo"}
