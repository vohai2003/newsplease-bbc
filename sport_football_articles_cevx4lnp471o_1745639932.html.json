FA Cup success would not represent a good season for Manchester City\nRewind to 2011 when the success over Stoke City ended a run of 35 years without a major trophy, it was a victory that started a new era at the football club.\nNow in 2025, it would be almost unimaginable to suggest to any supporter present at Wembley on that day that another FA Cup success would not represent a good season for the club.\nBut that is the reality of the modern City - a team that has been an all-conquering behemoth in English football with their triumphs and records under Guardiola.\nEveryone associated with the club is aware of this season's struggles. From early exits in the Carabao Cup and Champions League to the fall of their Premier League title challenge as early as November, as well as the widespread injury and fitness issues, there has been a significant drop-off in performances.\nCity face a monumental challenge to qualify for the Champions League so success in the FA Cup, where all the most stern challengers are already out, could arguably be viewed as the bare minimum.\nWinning the competition would paper over the cracks in a season that has brought very little to smile about and that is a view that is shared by the head coach, with Guardiola recently saying the campaign would still be viewed as \"not good\".\nAnd while City may be viewed as favourites to claim the world's most illustrious domestic knockout competition, Bournemouth away in the quarter-finals remains a firm challenge before they can even contemplate a place at Wembley .\nBut let's get things straight; while the FA Cup may not make it a good season as a whole for City, the idea of major silverware to end a campaign of disappointment remains a mouth-watering possibility.\nAnd that is particularly for the players who may be featuring in their final matches for City over the final weeks of the season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cevx4lnp471o"}
