It is good news to have offers from other clubs. We want to keep our sporting objective through the players we have in the squad.\n\"Every player can be in the market if it is good for the player and the club. To get this deal we are going to be demanding. Watkins is our striker.\"\nVilla have signed forward Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund during the window but he is widely viewed as a replacement for Moussa Diaby, who joined Al-Ittihad in the summer.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20gkk6k1v0o"}
