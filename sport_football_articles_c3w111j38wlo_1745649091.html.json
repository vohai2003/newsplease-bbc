Therefore, we were dismayed to learn that NIFL instead would look to make a donation to charity,\" said the club's statement.\n\"While charitable donations are of course always welcome, unfortunately this gesture does nothing to help our supporters clubs at a time when many are struggling to cover the price of hiring buses because of rising transport costs.\"\nThe Portadown statement added that it was \"unacceptable that our supporters clubs have been left substantially out of pocket for what was an unnecessary and needless journey, and also deeply let down that they will not be compensated as was publicly suggested\".\n\"We will now consider our options, but as a sign of appreciation to our supporters clubs who have travelled the width and breadth of the country all season, we will endeavour to make sure that we assist them financially, so that they do not have to fully burden the cost of decisions that were out of their control.\"\nLinfield's statement said: \"This outcome is deeply disappointing for the club and its supporters clubs as expectations were raised that a goodwill gesture would be forthcoming to compensate supporters clubs for the unnecessary travel.\"\nThe Belfast club added that it would cover 50% of the travel costs incurred by its supporters on 7 December and had accepted NIFL's offer to make a charitable donation, which will go to the club's main charity partner, the NI Children's Hospice.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c3w111j38wlo"}
