The effort of the group was outstanding and we didn't get the result we probably deserved.\n\"We didn't create many chances but neither did they - it was a tight game.\n\"It is a mad few weeks coming up but that's the Championship. That's why all we can do is concentrate on what we can do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clywngg0n49o"}
