We were outstanding. I couldn't be prouder of the players. I couldn't ask any more. It is a game that we would have won if all things were equal.\n\"If all things were equal and balanced, we would have won. Things weren't equal and balanced.\"\nOn what wasn't equal in the game and whether he was hinting at Newcastle's opener: \"You can talk about whatever you want. You want my opinion: if all things were equal and balanced, we would have won.\n\"We had plenty of chances. Our football was outstanding, considering everything we are going through.\n\"If it was an even playing field, we would have won.\"\nOn goalkeeper Brandon Austin: \"He was really good. The moment we are going through, we are putting big tasks on players and they are rising to occasion.\n\"The performance deserved a victory.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c78533x2y80o"}
