It was just a matter of time. Next season we will be in the Championship and it is the beginning of something new. We have to build something good around the club.\n\"We can't change the past, the only thing we can do in the last seven games is to enjoy being in the Premier League. We have to improve as players and as a club. Hopefully we are going to build something great.\n\"The best thing is that we can learn, we can work hard and we can improve. Hopefully we can perform better in the last seven games. We want to get more points, I don't think 10 is enough. Hopefully we will get more points.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c175e85ngwzo"}
