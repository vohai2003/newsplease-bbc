Being in the Champions League where we are is unbelievable and now we also have an FA Cup semi-final.\n\"Tactically, Emery is one of the best out there. He's gradually changed the whole philosophy of the football club.\n\"Villa fans have had to be patient with the way he wants to play, but everyone has fully bought in to what he wants to do. The mindset is totally different, we are really heading in the right direction.\"\nVilla will play Crystal Palace in the semi-finals at Wembley next month.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62jrpn5n7do"}
