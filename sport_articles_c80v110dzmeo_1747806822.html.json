We love playing at home,\" manager Rodgers told Celtic TV.\n\"But it's one that we're looking forward to, one we want to take three points and we want to put on a performance that merits all the great support that we get.\n\"It will be tough. Motherwell will defend the space deep and we'll have to be really bright and clever in order to break through that pressure.\n\"We had a challenging game against them earlier in the season [3-0 win at Fir Park], so I would expect the same. We would just need to be more clinical in our game than what we have been recently.\n\"We had a number of guys out on Sunday so hopefully we arrive into Thursday's game, we'll see how they are but we should have one or two back to give us that depth in our squad.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c80v110dzmeo"}
