It suited perfectly with our own weaknesses and we were dominated one-v-one.\n\"After their second goal, we played to our strengths and it was more positive as it's not easy to change the dynamic of a game.\n\"Our second half was better with some subs and at the end, their goalkeeper was man-of-the-match, so we had chances to win.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8qrmdnq8vo"}
