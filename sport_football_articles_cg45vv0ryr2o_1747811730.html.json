I thought we were a bit light in there. We've now got four midfielders who I can play against each other in training,\" boss Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio Northampton.\n\"I think he's going to be a great addition to the squad in terms of his character - he's a winner, he wants to prove something.\n\"He showed a real eagerness and desire to come and play for Northampton, play for me, and he's going to make the squad much better.\"\nTaylor is Northampton's second signing of the January transfer window following former Fleetwood midfielder Liam Shaw, and he could make his Cobblers debut away to second-placed Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg45vv0ryr2o"}
