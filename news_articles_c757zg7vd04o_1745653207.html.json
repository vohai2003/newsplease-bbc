That's 20 long years of unimaginable torment for a loving family,\" she said.\n\"Yet, despite their pain, they've never given up their search for answers and, likewise, our determination has remained steadfast.\"\nThe officer said those responsible for her murder \"have not yet been held to account\" and she appealed to witnesses to \"do the right thing\".\nThe Dorrian family, including her younger sister Joanne, have led a high-profile campaign in a bid to find Lisa's body and bring her killers to justice.\nAt Thursday's press conference, Joanne Dorrian said: \"Lisa lost her life at the hands of people she knew and trusted.\"\nShe said she would have \"laughed and joked with these people\" on the night she went missing and would \"never have imagined\" they would have caused her harm.\n\"Our family has never been the same since the day we got the news that Lisa went missing,\" Joanne added.\n\"Our mum went to her grave never knowing what happened to her beautiful first-born daughter.\"\nShe said her family's grief and pain has been \"all consuming\" and her \"absence in all of our lives has grown over the years\".\nThe Dorrians are now stepping up their appeal with a new digital billboard and bus shelter poster campaign.\nJoanne Dorrian told reporters that her older sister had been \"denied all of her hopes and dreams\" but the family \"hope to see Lisa's murderers in court one day soon\".\nIn a direct appeal to those who know the killers, she said: \"Twenty years of secrecy could end with a phone call, a letter, a message.\n\"Please tell us where Lisa is.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c757zg7vd04o"}
