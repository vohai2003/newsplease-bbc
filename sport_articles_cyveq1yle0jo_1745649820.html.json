They were brave on the ball. They showed quality at key moments and were clinical, for the most part, when given the opportunity.\nMichael Wimmer talked about having to win duals before the game and they fought for everything in pursuit of the points.\nThe concession of the goal was down to an individual error and for most of the match they held Rangers very well, limiting clear-cut chances.\nRangers fell short but Motherwell played a big part in that.\nThey will take a lot of encouragement from how they performed in delivering a second win on the trot that will do wonders for their top six hopes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cyveq1yle0jo"}
