We played well but the league is relentless. There were warning signs before the goal and we have to recognise the dangers. The lads are saying it was a blatant handball in the build-up to their goal but the [officials'] positions meant they probably didn't have a great view of it.\n\"We can't use that as an excuse - we've got to be stronger. The games come thick and fast and we didn't lose, we got a point and we'll take that. We needed to recognise where we could hurt them, and that was out wide. The conditions being windy made it more difficult to get out in the first half.\n\"It was easier in the second half but we didn't exploit that enough. A lot of their players were going down with cramp and none of ours did, which shows how much work we put in during the off-season.\n\"It's always a good personal landmark to get my first goal on the first day. I should have scored in the first half but that's the life of a forward - you have to put it behind you and take the next one. I want to hit at least double figures.\"\nPreston manager Ryan Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire:\n\"We were excellent. The goal jolted us but we stuck to the gameplan and were unlucky not to take three points. We were fantastic from start to finish. With them being the home team, we felt they'd come out a little bit more. Once they got the goal, it sort of backfired on them. We got our backsides in gear more, passed and ran forward and were on the front foot. We had opportunities and had them on the ropes.\n\"We could potentially have won it but you'll take a point at Bristol City - they've got some good players, you can see that.\n\"The gameplan in the first half was spot on. In the second half, we changed shape because we felt we could get more bodies up the pitch. It worked to an extent.\n\"I don't want to put too much pressure on Will [Keane] in terms of goals because we didn't score as many as we wanted last season. He adds another 14, potentially. When Ched [Evans] and Emil [Riis Jakobsen] are back, we'll get one more through the door and then if the midfielders can chip in, it will help. I had ultimate faith when I signed Will that he would score goals. It was a fantastic finish.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66345310"}
