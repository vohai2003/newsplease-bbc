That is my type of style, so I think I will fit in here.\n“We were the biggest team in Poland, so there was a lot of pressure, which I’m used to, but it’s different because we didn’t have Champions League football there, but I’m more excited and looking forward to it.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckrjyl90m7go"}
