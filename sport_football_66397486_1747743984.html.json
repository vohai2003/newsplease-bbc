I'm not sure where the streams are at these days,\" he said.\n\"Ideally, I wouldn't be banned but I shouldn't have sworn at the referee and I've got to prove my behaviour certainly when decisions go wrong against you.\"\nRovers have made eight signings so far this transfer window with defender Connor Taylor - who was part of the promotion-winning side from League Two in 2021-22 - re-signing from Stoke on a permanent deal this week.\nBarton said the club would like to add more players before the end of the summer.\n\"We've got several more to do I think before we've got all the pieces of the jigsaw for the first part of the season,\" he said.\n\"But we've done the lion's share of the work. We'll be hanging around deadline day hopefully looking for one, that usually is a sign of good business and maybe just as an x-factor one there you're not wanting on three or four because it's never a good time.\n\"Once that window closes that's your group and you get cracking, you've had a few games before that but also you know where you are as a team and the work you've got to do.\"\nRovers finished 17th in League One last season and secured new investment this week through new co-owner Kuwaiti businessman Hussain AlSaeed.\n\"We've just got to get better. The recruitment we've chosen has certainly developed us in areas of the team we felt we were lacking last year,\" Barton added.\n\"I'm confident with our group where we are, the work we've got to do. We tend to improve over the course of a season and I think a lot of our lads will benefit from the experiences of last year and Saturday for us is an opportunity for us to learn more about our team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66397486"}
