I know it's a big club with a lot of history and the supporters are really passionate so it was a no brainer for me.\n\"As soon as I spoke to the manager and heard about what he wants to achieve here, I just wanted to get up here as soon as possible. I believe the way he wants to play will suit my style and he just wants this to be the best part of my career.\n\"It's my first loan so I want to start as many games as I can, work hard and I hope I can repay the faith the manager has shown in me.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn93xvll2e4o"}
