We have a lot of quality in our group. We have a lot of injuries, especially upfront. We know that but it is a beautiful challenge.\n\"We have been through a lot, especially the last couple of weeks. It is a challenge for us and we just have to take it. \"\nHaving failed to score against West Ham and Nottingham Forest, Arsenal have slipped further behind Liverpool in the title race and Timber was asked how to bring positivity back to Emirates Stadium.\n\"Change the narrative by winning games - it's as easy as that,\" he said. \"We have to score tomorrow. In the Champions League you only have two games so you don't get second chances.\n\"I feel like I'm part of something big with this team and we can win a lot. We can do everything we can to win prizes and tomorrow is another step towards that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/crrd74kpjzdo"}
