The club were supportive of it and it was a chance for me to get a little bit extra. Eastleigh have been great which I'm very grateful for.\"\nThe Spitfires are currently 11th in the National League, six points off the league's play-off positions with six games remaining.\nThey are managed by former Southampton goalkeeper Kelvin Davis who was appointed in February 2024 and signed a new three-year deal a few months later in April.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9qwvd5x9xyo"}
