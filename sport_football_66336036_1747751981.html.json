First of all, I would like to express my sincere apologies to the fans and supporters of FC Tokyo who warmly welcomed my return, as I will be transferring immediately.\n\"I am also filled with gratitude towards the team officials who respected my wishes and supported me. Just when I was determined to start from scratch and do my best, I received an offer and couldn't give up on my dream of challenging myself overseas, so I made this decision.\"\nMeanwhile, Hearts are also being linked, external with the permanent signing of 21-year-old forward Kenneth Vargas from Herediano in the Costa Rican top flight.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66336036"}
