I wish her well and hope she has a safe flight home.\"\nDubois was upgraded from interim to full world champion after Katie Taylor vacated her belt. She has called for a unification fight with Doncaster's WBO champion Terri Harper next.\nBarnsley's Callum Simpson defended his British and Commonwealth super-middleweight title with a second-round stoppage of Steed Woodall in the main event.\nThe 29-year-old Simpson sent Woodall to the canvas with a barrage of shots, before the referee intervened after another attack moments later, despite the protests of Woodall, 30.\nIt was not the outcome Dubois wanted, but an otherwise impressive four minutes of boxing from the champion.\nHer entrance to a dance remix of Whitney Houston's 'I'm every woman' hyped up the sold-out 3,000 crowd, made up almost entirely of fans supporting Yorkshireman Simpson.\nDubois came out with real intent. She landed a crisp body shot early in round one, before flooring Camara with the southpaw left.\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Chris Billam-Smith cheered his stablemate on from ringside as Dubois landed hurtful, menacing power punches.\nCamara was on a four-fight winning streak, but the Montreal fighter was clearly out of her depth as she sighed on return to the corner.\nDubois continued to bulldoze her way through in the second, grunting with each punch thrown.\nShe looked set for a sixth stoppage win before the disappointing finish brought a premature end to proceedings. If the contest had gone past the fourth round, it would have been decided by the judges' scorecards.\n\"The cut was on the side and it [blood] wasn't dropping in the eye. I was surprised we didn't go past four rounds,\" added Dubois' trainer Shane McGuigan.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cn8yjlv6y52o"}
