It's not only the improvement on the pitch, it's having someone in the squad with a proven winning mentality and pedigree for the younger players to learn from.\nLucy: Letting an experienced player/leader/winner like Casemiro leave could prove detrimental in the long run. How many other United fans wanted Jonny Evans to stay when he was initially sold? How many were annoyed when Zlatan Ibrahimovic left? The kids need leaders, and it can't just be left to Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire.\nYusuf: To be honest, Casemiro had a good performance against City but I feel he still has a lot of improving to do and I don't think that one match is going to determine his future unless he shines like he did against City for the remainder of the games we have left.\nAllan: He is obviously past the standard required by the Premier League and United should ship him out as soon as possible. We have too many passengers, including Hojlund and Mount. Bring in the juniors and give them a chance.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3r8nwwx82po"}
