You really want to win games.\n\"We are a little bit frustrated because we started the year well here with two great games against Liverpool and Arsenal, then Southampton we had good resilience but didn't play good football. We had the game with Brighton which didn't go for us.\n\"We want to get through the Europa League and get to the final in Bilbao. We want to get top eight so we don't have to play two more games.\n\"It's not about the character. We have to prove that in the 90 minutes, we can't bring that out when we concede a goal. We concede a late goal and we have to score a late goal.\n\"At this club, you need to win every game. You know that if you don't win games here, it will be difficult. I hope our fans never get used to losing games. I hope they believe in this team to win games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c04ndnlqlx7o"}
