It was like this a week before, two weeks before, three months before. Today we dropped two points which is very painful, we have the Champions League, a beautiful competition in front of us.\n\"I'm very disappointed not to win, the standard was different to the previous game [a 1-0 defeat to West Ham] with the energy and the willingness to make things happen.\n\"We dominated the game, apart from one experience in the second half and one or two giveaways which allowed them to run. Apart from that nothing. When we opened them up we lacked the quality in the final pass and delivery and be more efficient.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c98445nl6jno"}
