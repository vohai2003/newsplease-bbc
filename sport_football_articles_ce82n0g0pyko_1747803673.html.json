The last time the Canaries scored 10 league goals against an opponent in a season was against Millwall in 2014-15 (10).\nAcross their past 13 home games in all competitions, Plymouth's only clean sheet came against current Premier League leaders Liverpool in a 1-0 FA Cup win in February.\nOf Norwich's last 36 Championship goals, only six have them been scored away from home. Just 26% of their goals have been scored on the road (16/61) with only Plymouth scoring a lower percentage away (8/40, 20%).\nJosh Sargent has scored nine goals in his past 11 Championship appearances for Norwich and overall he's scored 42 in 93 games at this level â€“ the only Canaries player with more since 2004-05 is Teemu Pukki (65).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce82n0g0pyko"}
