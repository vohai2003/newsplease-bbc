I can guarantee all supporters will welcome that ambition, though it is inevitable that there will be some abrasion as it changes its business model and alters processes in a bid to control its brand and its message.\nTo oil the relationships, the trick will be to limit any feeling of disenfranchisement for those who, in more straitened times, have been the lifeblood of the football club. The club will still need those people to be foot soldiers in the battle it has to win over political opinion about the merits of building a new stadium just north of the city.
