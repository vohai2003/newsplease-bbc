And Blues will start as favourites to emulate that feat on Sunday when they will face Posh again - this time at Wembley in the final of the EFL Trophy.\nBirmingham City manager Chris Davies to BBC Radio WM:\n\"A special night - obviously it means the world to see the fans celebrate, it really is something special.\n\"I have said previously how the club has suffered a lot, particularly in the last couple of years.\n\"It is about creating memories, bringing them some joy and making them proud of their club and I think we have done that this season, so for me it means the world.\n\"I thought we maintained a good level throughout the game, I thought the subs that came on kept us at that good level and I thought we finished it well.\n\"I have had a lot of ups and downs in football - to come to a club like this and do this is obviously the pinnacle of my career so far.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cx2w7nnq0q3t"}
