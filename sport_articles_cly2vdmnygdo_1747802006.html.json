It's about believing, sticking by it.\n\"It's a transitional moment, there's a lot of young players there. Not winning games hurts but that pressure and expectation is a reward for the progress, it's a reward for being in League A and it's part of the journey.\n\"There will be results in the future because of the young players we're bringing through at the moment.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cly2vdmnygdo"}
