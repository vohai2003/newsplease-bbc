They did have success with him out of the team last season but that was only for a few games and not for a number of months, which they will have to deal with at the start of this campaign.\nThe front three of Bryan Mbuemo, Yoane Wissa and Kean Lewis-Potter is showing promise. They linked up well in their 2-0 defeat to Brighton and also the 3-2 defeat to Fulham.\nThey also have new goalkeeper Mark Flekken integrating into the squad, while there is speculation over David Rayaâ€™s future.\nSummer signing from Wolves Nathan Collins played at centre-back and is forming a partnership with Ben Mee.\nBrentford have played good football in the two games so far this pre-season but it may take a few more weeks before we see them back at their best.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cv2r7lvlp94o"}
