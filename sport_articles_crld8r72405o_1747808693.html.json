I think tactically, we got it spot on because they can hurt you; they hurt us last time.\n\"We learned from that, tweaked a few things from the weekend, and the players are turning up; they're making my life hard to pick a team and keep them all happy.\n\"They've set standards over the past couple of weeks now, and I felt it was a comfortable victory, and we controlled the game for the majority.\"\nHearts manager Eva Olid: \"I think the first minutes of the match we started making simple mistakes and mentally we couldn't recover from those mistakes.\n\"Mentally, I think we were not ourselves, and it's difficult because we need the ball to play and when we had the ball we were committing simple mistakes and losing it so easily.\n\"I think the confidence of the players went down. It's so frustrating because if you lose a game playing yourself, you cannot do anything, but I know we lost mainly because we didn't play like we did against Celtic, for example.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crld8r72405o"}
