But it's not United, it's the people, you know?\" said Guardiola.\n\"We are so exposed, people who are on the screen in world football - managers, owners, and football players especially.\n\"Honestly, I don't understand the mind of the people involving the mum of Phil. It's a lack of integrity, class, and they should be ashamed.\"\nThe outcome of the game means City remain fifth in the Premier League, a point behind Chelsea in fourth, with United back in 13th.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c045nxw2yz5o"}
