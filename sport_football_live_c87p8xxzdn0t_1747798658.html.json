Josh Feeney slipped in the midfielder, who drove into the box and slotted the ball past Pereira.\nReading got back in front just five minutes later through Kelvin Ehibhatiomhan, who struck the ball into the top corner from close range.\nAaron Pierre went close for the hosts past the hour mark, but his deflected effort from inside the area got pushed over.\nAnd Chem Campbell netted a third and final goal for the visitors – with under 20 minutes remaining – as he tucked his shot away at the back post.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c87p8xxzdn0t"}
