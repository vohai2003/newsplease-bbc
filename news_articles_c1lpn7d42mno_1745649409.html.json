It puts a lot of stress on them,\" Mr Montague said.\nTeachers who relocate to Guernsey from off-island are eligible for rent allowance, external, if their accommodation costs more than Â£185 per week.\nMr Montague said in spite of this, the cost of living remained an issue and teaching needed to become a more attractive career in terms of income and working environment, to retain teachers for longer.\nHe said the high turnover has a negative impact on student attainment.\n\"One of the major problems we've got in the secondary sector especially in terms of youngsters' progress in any subject is that we've got a massive turnover of teachers.\n\"Teacher turnover really causes massive problems for youngsters' progress. I speak to youngsters who've really fallen out of love with subjects they struggle with because they don't have that relationship with a teacher.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lpn7d42mno"}
