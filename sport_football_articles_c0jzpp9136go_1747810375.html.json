We should go in two or three-nil up,\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire. \"But the main thing is we won.\n\"We missed some big chances, but we created them and looked a real threat and a top team.\n\"In the second half, we had some big moments but didn't execute them.\n\"There is always - at 1-0, at the back end of the game - a worry. It's tricky because they have nothing to lose and load the top line with five or six players. The game can become a little bit edgy.\n\"But overall I am delighted with the way we performed. They are an in-form team and we knew it was going to be a tough test. I am really impressed with the way we performed.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0jzpp9136go"}
