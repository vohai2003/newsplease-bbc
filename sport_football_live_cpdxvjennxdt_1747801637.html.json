We've got Calum Scanlon who's literally trained for one week, and he's a left-back and I've got him playing left wing, so it's not easy.\"\nHull boss Ruben Selles told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\"It's difficult always to come here and try to perform. We had some phases that we controlled the game and created situations when we should go in front.\n\"There were some situations where we didn't find the pass and ended up being under pressure, but overall I think it was a good performance.\n\"My team showed they can play in defensive scenarios and still be powerful, aggressive and win football matches.\n\"With the goal, Regan is a fantastic ball carrier, he attacked the space and we were in the situation where we had a runner at the first post, runner at the back post, another runner arriving, and every ball there either we'll score or it's very difficult to defend, and it went in.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cpdxvjennxdt"}
