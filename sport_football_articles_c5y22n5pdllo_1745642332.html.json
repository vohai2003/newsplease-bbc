The U's haven't endured a longer run without scoring since a five-match stint in October 1996.\nCoventry have won seven of their last eight league games (L1), as many as across their prior 32 Championship outings combined since April last year.\nSince the weekend of Frank Lampard's first match in charge of Coventry at the end of November, only the current top three of Leeds, Sheffield United and Burnley have earned more points in the Championship than the Sky Blues (32).", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c5y22n5pdllo"}
