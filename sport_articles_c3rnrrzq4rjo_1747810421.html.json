If I'm being critical there were two or three times in the second half we could have been a bit more clinical but I've got no complaints, the boys were brilliant today.\n\"At the start of the season the aim is to finish in the top six minimum for this football club. Then you start to look towards European places and if that's achievable. That's the target, that's the aim.\n\"We had a real difficult start, had to go through that adversity at the start of the season but that's now 15 games undefeated in the league which has given us the opportunity to secure top six with two games to go.\n\"We can't catch the team in front now so we're now the team being chased down. Nobody can catch you if you win games of football so that's the challenge to the players now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3rnrrzq4rjo"}
