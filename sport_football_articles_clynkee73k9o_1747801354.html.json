The performance was not as good as we wanted but, at the end of the day, it was a fair result.\n\"We didn't play as we wanted, we conceded too many chances and we had opportunities to score more goals.\n\"The effort was there. The mentality was there because we came back.\n\"But, when you are 2-1 up at 75 minutes, you have to defend better and we couldn't do it, so we have to think about what we did wrong and move on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clynkee73k9o"}
