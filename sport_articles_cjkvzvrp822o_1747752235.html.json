You have to have this combination of feelings from me and the club.\n\"First of all, you must have belief and confidence in your qualities, which I have.\n\"Then, for me, one of the most important parts is having that positive energy and feedback from the manager, to know that he also believes in your work and that you can be a part of the club for the upcoming years.\n\"When you have that, I think for me, it was straight away the answer I needed to sign the contract and to keep going at this club.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjkvzvrp822o"}
