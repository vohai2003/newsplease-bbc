I have no idea how I kept it quiet but I managed to - I just want to shout out the club and say thank you for being so accommodating,\" Jack told BBC Radio Norfolk.\n\"I wasn't sure I'd be able to when I came up with the idea, but they were brilliant - what an afternoon.\"\nBrandis was attending her first football match and said: \"We were going out there and I thought 'do I have to kick this?' because I don't know how to kick a football.\n\"We've been together two-ish years but I was not expecting that right now.\"\nFortunately, she also said yes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g2vvdy8r2o"}
