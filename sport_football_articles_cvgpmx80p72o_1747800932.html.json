They created way more chances and dominated. We came in at half-time and things had to change.\n\"In the second half, we created many chances but it is the goals you need and unfortunately we just couldn't get them today. It's frustrating. We created many chances, we just couldn't get it over the line, but the positives are there.\n\"That's what let us down [the first-half performance]. We are usually so compact and strong in the first 15 minutes, because that's when teams can get at you. That's what killed us.\n\"The reaction we showed was positive but it was just not enough.\n\"We will be straight back in to do our recovery and back on the grass to work towards Everton, another massive game. The final games are huge for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgpmx80p72o"}
