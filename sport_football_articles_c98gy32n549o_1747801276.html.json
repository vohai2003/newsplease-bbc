It is his attitude, aura and experience that has benefited Wrexham. A player prepared to lead the line and lead by example.\n\"He's incredible,\" said defender Eoghan O'Connell of a player who has played more than 200 top-flight games and cost clubs more than Â£20m in transfer fees.\n\"His performances speak for themselves. It could have been easy for him to come here, getting to the end of his career, and just fob it off - but he's just brilliant and a brilliant person.\n\"The influence he's had on the whole team since he came here, the way he is off the pitch, he's so popular in the dressing room, everyone loves him.\"\nGrouping Fletcher with captain and fellow former top-flight pro James McClean, manager Parkinson praised the standards he sets and the messages he sends.\nThere was credit, too, for the assistance he has given Sam Smith, the January signing who added Wrexham's second on Saturday before Jack Marriott wrapped up the scoring.\n\"He brings us so much,\" said Parkinson of frontman Fletcher, who has made 35 appearances this year, only two of which have been starts.\n\"He understands where he is in his career.\"\nParkinson added: \"His last year was at Dundee United and a club in a difficult situation. I think when he looks back he'll be so pleased he didn't finish his career then.\n\"I think he was fifty-fifty but he's had a real lift from coming here. He's enjoyed it and I've really enjoyed having him.\"\nFletcher suggested in his pre-match interview he may well want that feeling to continue beyond the contract that expires at the end of the season.\n\"When you're enjoying something so much and you still feel like you're making an impact when you're playing I don't see why you would want to stop,\" he stated in the programme.\nFor now, Wrexham will hope his influence remains for a final five games of a season that could yet be another Hollywood success.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c98gy32n549o"}
