It’s the first game with a little bit of toughness because we were playing against a team in the Champions League. They are always a very competitive team, so it was very important for us.\n\"The other teams we have played are also very good, and we had difficult games, but versus Porto, they have a little bit more investment also.\n\"For us, it’s important to put your head inside, know what you need to do, and after this 1-0 we need to keep this up for the whole season - win every game and go home happy.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c14z9zxdlnlo"}
