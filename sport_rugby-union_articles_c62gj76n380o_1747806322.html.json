The former Ireland captain was handed the interim head coach reins following confirmation that Easterby - who filled in for Farrell during the Six Nations - has joined the Lions coaching ticket.\nO'Connell has spent the past four years as Ireland's forwards coach, but this is a considerable step-up for the 45-year-old.\nSuccession planning is key to Ireland's future. Farrell is contracted until the end of the 2027 World Cup. If he leaves after that tournament, the Irish Rugby Football Union [IRFU] will at least know how two of his possible successors in Easterby and O'Connell have fared while leading the team.\nO'Connell's remit will be clear: improve morale after a third-place finish in the Six Nations and identify new Test talent, which is a pressing concern given the age profile of the senior squad.\nO'Connell will, however, have experienced coaches he knows well alongside him. He played alongside Denis Leamy and Mike Prendergast at Munster and will have Colm Tucker to oversee the scrum.\nThe input of Prendergast, in particular, will be valuable after he led the Ireland 'A' team against England in February.\nJohnny Sexton, who was involved in the Irish coaching set-up during the autumn Tests and Six Nations, was not named as part of O'Connell's team, so it will be interesting to see if the iconic fly-half links up with the squad closer to the Test against Georgia on 5 July.\nRegardless of his involvement, though, it will be a big summer for O'Connell and his presumably youthful Ireland squad.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c62gj76n380o"}
