He equipped himself really well last season in a poor team.\n\"You can understand why he would want to go. He is a US international and does not want to be playing in the Championship.\n\"This would be a really smart bit of business for Villa, who are my dark horses next season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg34ek7wnk0o"}
