The Eagles beat us handily in the quarter-finals, despite us all believing it was our year.\nThen on Sunday, we came from behind to complete the double over our close rivals, Brentford, severely denting their European ambitions in the process.\nBut despite our dramatic derby victory, I can't help feeling hollow.\nOur win, though it takes us to 54 points, a record for us in the Premier League, did not boost our own European hopes much. It is still out of our hands, and it would take a mini miracle to finish in that coveted eighth spot.\nThat has been the problem this campaign. It has constantly proved a challenge to gauge whether it has been a success or not.\nMarco Silva said before the Brentford game that it is \"impossible\" to call this season a failure. I disagree. Though I do not think it has been a failure, I can absolutely see why others might consider it one.\nThis has been one of the most open and unpredictable domestic seasons in history. Just 13 points separate third from 10th, and we were in that European mix for 90% of the campaign. To finish outside that - and possibly even in the bottom half - is a massive missed opportunity.\nNevertheless, we have been treated to some incredible moments. The double over Brentford; a last-minute winner at Stamford Bridge; a penalty shootout victory at Old Trafford; taking four points from champions Liverpool, just to name a few.\nSo, as the season draws to a close, perhaps perspective is needed. Real progress next year would be surpassing what we achieved this year â€“ then maybe we will be the ones lifting silverware.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0k3xeje23yo"}
