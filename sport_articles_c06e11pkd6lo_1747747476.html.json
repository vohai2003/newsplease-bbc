Liverpool have signed two midfielders already, but then they have lost five. They definitely need one more.\n\"That perhaps is Lavia and there could be a centre-back potentially as well. Honestly, with Liverpool this summer, I just don't know any more!\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c06e11pkd6lo"}
