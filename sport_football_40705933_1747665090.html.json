As a manager I'd rather judge him in training rather than loads of saves in a game because that means he's being worked too much.\n\"In terms of his overall play, he was composed with his feet, very calm in possession and made a save when he had to. That's what you want from your keepers.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40705933"}
