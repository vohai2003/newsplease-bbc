We showed character after that start. I'm proud of how they came back. It's not easy. That's why it was well deserved.\n\"Mistakes happen. If a keeper makes a mistake normally it's a goal. We try to support him because he's a great goalkeeper.\n\"Georginio Rutter is doing good. He adapted quickly to the intensity of the Premier League. He has great skills and showed it today.\n\"It was a togetherness on the pitch. It's a team performance. They bounced back, they stuck together. They didn't point fingers after losing. They took ownership.\"\nOn no VAR: \"But that's it. That's football. With VAR football is getting not that emotional like today. Everyone agrees that today was a great atmosphere. They can celebrate a goal because they know it's a goal. I'm happy it was like that.\n\"We always try to stay grounded and work hard. We try not to get euphoric after a good win or panic after a defeat.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2k4j21547o"}
