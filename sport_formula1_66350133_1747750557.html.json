Permane had been with the team since 1989.\nProst contrasted what he said was the corporate influence on Alpine with the successful eras at Ferrari in the 2000s, Mercedes in the 2010s and Red Bull now.\nProst said: \"Ferrari worked with Jean Todt relying on Ross Brawn and Michael Schumacher; Mercedes enjoyed success with Toto Wolff backed by Niki Lauda and James Allison with Lewis Hamilton spearheading.\n\"Red Bull, even if it is not backed by a major manufacturer, does the same. It is Christian Horner and Adrian Newey who manage for their two drivers, Sebastian Vettel and now Max Verstappen.\n\"And in these three cases, there was a strong president who was completely involved in F1 to support the action taken: Luca di Montezemolo, Dieter Zetsche and Dietrich Mateschitz.\n\"They had the codes of F1, the agility and flexibility to let their men make the decisions.\"\nHe pointed out that Renault had only been successful in F1 when they followed the same model with Flavio Briatore and Fernando Alonso in 2005-6.\nHe added: \"Funny to see that the leaders of F1 are often invited to conferences on management by large groups in order to talk about responsiveness and flexibility. Rarely the reverseâ€¦\"\nAlpine's new motorsport director, Bruno Famin, will be acting team principal while he conducts an assessment of the team's operations following his appointment two weeks ago.\nFamin said they had split with Szafnauer and Permane because \"at one stage we realised that we were not on the same line on a couple of topics\".\nHe added: \"The competition is so hard and if we are not 100% aligned I think we all have enough experience to know that it's useless to continue together and everybody has chosen to go his own route.\"\nQuestioned on the wisdom of making so many changes in such a short space of time, Famin said: \"Stability can be also a way of doing always the same result in the same way and not progressing. Here, [if we] would have been much closer to the top teams this season, for sure things would have been different.\n\"But we need to in terms of stability and building things. Now, we need to make some changes to move forward and to go faster and to change this stability, which is quite counterproductive at this stage.\"\nAlpine set themselves the target this year of finishing fourth for the second consecutive season and moving closer to the top three teams.\nInstead, they are sixth at the halfway point and have been leapfrogged by McLaren and Aston Martin, who signed Fernando Alonso, a driver Alpine lost because Rossi would not offer him a two-year contract as he believed there was a risk his performance would tail off.\nFamin said one of the reasons Alpine had fallen behind was that their engine was not as good as those of rivals Ferrari, Honda and Mercedes.\nAsked why Alpine/Renault had not been able to make the same progress as their competitors despite operating under the same rules, he said: \"I don't have anything at all about that. I cannot comment on that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/66350133"}
