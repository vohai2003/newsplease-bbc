One would serve North Leicestershire and Rutland - currently covered by Charnwood borough - North West Leicestershire district, Melton borough and Rutland County Council.\nA separate council would serve South Leicestershire, currently covered by Blaby district, Harborough district, Hinckley and Bosworth borough and Oadby and Wigston borough councils.\nLeicester city would remain unchanged.\nThe districts and boroughs claim this model would create \"three well-balanced unitary councils serving a similar number of residents, simpler local government structures, so it is easier to understand who does what and councils that are more local, accessible and accountable\".\nLeicestershire County Council has put forward its plan for one council authority across the county. It is built on established boundaries with the city, and excludes Rutland.\nCounty Hall claims its idea would improve services for residents, save money, simplify a confusing system and protect front-line services.\nIt could also unlock devolved powers and funding - giving the authority more money to fix roads and other services, plus new powers to coordinate planning and join-up transport.\nDistricts and boroughs claim the single unitary authority would be \"too cumbersome, remote, and inaccessible for local communities\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgee1zw8zxo"}
