In part three, we look at boardroom changes at St Mary's.\nSimon asked: What do you think Johannes Spors will bring to the club in the short and medium term? Do you get the sense he will want to bring in his own manager or do you think Ivan Juric has a chance of being at the helm for the Championship campaign next season?\nAdam: Potentially, Spors could make a huge difference to the club.\nThere has been an unclear recruitment policy under Sport Republic so far, with, for example, Russell Martin, Darren Mowbray, Rasmus Ankersen, Phil Parsons and Henrik Kraft all involved last summer.\nThat cannot be right - it is just too woolly and people are not going to agree on everything.\nSpors should be allowed to use his knowledge and experience to run the recruitment policy in an aligned way with clear parameters, in conjunction with a new manager.\nHe should be the one to choose the new manager because they have to be aligned in their philosophy and united in where they want to take the club.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8kmm3k2gyo"}
