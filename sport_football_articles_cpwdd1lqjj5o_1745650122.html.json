I really hope so.\nOliver Glasner's side have improved as the season has gone on and they are comfortably in mid-table of the Premier League without any danger of going down. A cup run would really cap this as a successful campaign for him.\nIt would have an even bigger impact for Palace's fans. I still remember Ian Wright's goals in the 1990 final where they lost to Manchester United in a replay. They lost to United in the 2016 final too, and it would be great to give them a new memory.\nThis won't be easy, because former Norwich boss Alex Neil took charge of Millwall at the end of last year and is doing a good job.\nThey have been quite stubborn in recent weeks and I'm expecting more of the same here, but the Eagles should edge it in normal time.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.
