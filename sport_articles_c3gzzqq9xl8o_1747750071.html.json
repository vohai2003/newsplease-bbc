There have been situations where we have been into where we thought we were going to get it over the line and we don't - that's the way it goes.\n\"A lack of goals is always a concern because you need to score to win games. We showed in the second half of the season that we needed to find different ways of scoring goals and we are going to have to do that going forwards. That is part of football.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3gzzqq9xl8o"}
