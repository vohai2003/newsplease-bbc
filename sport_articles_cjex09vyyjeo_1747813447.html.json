Really, really poor decisions, putting themselves in trouble.\n\"You look at the teams that Rangers have played recently and how they've got results. You've got to be solid, you've got to give yourself a base. St Johnstone are so wide open, easy to play against, concede terrible goals, and make individual errors as well.\n\"I just can't see a way back for them at the moment. They need to change their style of play.\n\"Everyone wants to play that expansive, attractive style of football, but you also need to win games of football. You need to put points on the board. So they're really struggling at the moment. They need to change something.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjex09vyyjeo"}
