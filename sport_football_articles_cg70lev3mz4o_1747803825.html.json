You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nMychelle was born and grew up in Stoke Newington, north London, but says there was no chance of her supporting her local club, Arsenal.\n\"I support Chelsea because of my step-dad - he always had their games on the TV - but my mum is a Tottenham fan and she was adamant that I could not support Arsenal,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\"There were not many other Chelsea fans around my estate but funnily enough one of my neighbours was a fan too.\n\"She was also the only other girl I knew who liked playing football too, so it was a bit of a coincidence that the one person I bonded with at school over football supported the same team I did.\n\"My hero was Didier Drogba. He was a great player, but he had amazing charisma too. He was so exciting to watch.\"\nAs well her musical career, Mychelle still plays football now - as a left-winger for Islington Borough Ladies in the Greater London Women's Football League.\n\"I didn't play for a while when I left school but then I got spotted playing in Finsbury Park, and invited to play for Islington Borough's beginner group,\" she explained.\n\"I loved it, and haven't stopped since - I played seven-a-side at first then 11-a-side for the reserves before I got into the first team.\n\"It's been an amazing journey and I've made some great friends - I'd recommend it to anyone. It is hard to play every weekend because I might have a gig somewhere, but I always travel back when I can.\n\"Once, I was playing up in Manchester on the Saturday night but I got the overnight coach back to London afterwards, so I could make Sunday's game. I got home at 7am, had a nap, played the game and then had to go straight to play another gig that evening. It was a bit tiring, but it was worth it!\"\nChris Sutton and Mychelle were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEverton 1-1 Arsenal\nThis is going to be difficult for Arsenal. Everton defended so well against Liverpool on Wednesday, and they carried a real threat too, with Beto running in behind.\nBukayo Saka was back for the Gunners against Fulham and he will obviously boost their attack but they have picked up a few defensive injuries, including Gabriel being out for the rest of the season.\nMikel Arteta's side have got Tuesday's Champions League tie with Real Madrid to think about and, on top of that, this is an early kick-off to deal with too. None of that helps.\nI want Arsenal to keep on winning to put some pressure on Liverpool but Everton drew 0-0 at Emirates Stadium in December, when Sean Dyche was in charge, and everything points towards a similar outcome this time.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nMychelle's prediction: Everton are at home and are really hard to beat - they draw a lot of games, so that's what I'm going for. 1-1\nCrystal Palace 2-1 Brighton\nThere are a few derby games this weekend and this one - the M23 derby - is one of my favourites.\nBoth of these teams surprised me a bit last time out, and not in a good way.\nCrystal Palace have been in great form but only drew with Southampton and I backed Brighton to beat Aston Villa, who absolutely walloped them in the end.\nI promise I am not going to go for a draw with every prediction I make this week but the last five meetings between these two at Selhurst Park have ended 1-1, so that scoreline seems like a decent shout this time too.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nMychelle's prediction: I have gone with Palace here, because they have been on such a good run. 2-1\nIpswich Town 1-2 Wolves\nI am going purely from the heart here, not because I have any feelings for Ipswich but purely because of what I know a Tractor Boys win will mean for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields.\nI have written Ipswich off plenty of times this season and said they are already down but they simply have to win this game otherwise they really can forget any hope of staying up.\nWhat a result it was for Kieran McKenna's side to win at Bournemouth on Wednesday, especially after Wolves had beaten West Ham on Tuesday.\nIt means that Ipswich are still one place and nine points behind 17th-placed Wolves. With eight games to go, they only have a slim chance of survival but at least they do have a chance, and they could put their nearest rivals under a bit of pressure by beating them here.\nThey have already beaten Wolves once this season, at Molineux in December, in Gary O'Neil's final game in charge of Wolves, and beating them again at home to get their second win this week would be huge when you consider they had only won three of their first 29 league games.\nMy head is not exactly convinced that will happen, if I am being entirely honest, even though Wolves' best player Matheus Cunha is still out suspended.\nMr Fields would probably prefer me not to tip Town to win anyway because I have usually been wrong when I've done that in the past, but I am going to say they will get over the line because I want him to be happy.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nMychelle's prediction: I am going with the home team again here. Ipswich played well against Bournemouth, and they really need this too. 2-1\nWest Ham 2-2 Bournemouth\nBournemouth are out of the FA Cup and have picked up only one point from their past five league games. They have had a good season, and beaten all the teams in the top five apart from Liverpool, but it is in danger of fizzling out.\nThat would be a shame, and not just for their players. Cherries boss Andoni Iraola could do with a strong finish to the campaign to ensure his reputation continues to grow.\nIt finished 1-1 when these two sides met at the Vitality Stadium before Christmas and I am pretty sure the BBC readers will go for a draw this time too.\nWest Ham have struggled at home of late, losing three of their past four there, with their only win coming against Leicester.\nBournemouth's form doesn't suggest they will take the points either, but I am not sitting on the fence like I expect you lot will.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nMychelle's prediction: I know I am going for all the home teams but I do think West Ham will have more energy and will go for it a bit more. 1-0\nAston Villa 2-1 Nottingham Forest\nNottingham Forest are flying, but so are Aston Villa - they have now won six on the spin in all competitions.\nForest nicked the points late on at the City Ground when Villa went there in December, coming from 1-0 down after 87 minutes to win it in stoppage time.\nThis will be just as close, and I cannot really call a winner.\nEven if they do drop points here, I am still confident Forest will finish in the Champions League places.\nWe saw again when they beat Manchester United on Tuesday that they are not bothered about possession because of their threat on the break and Anthony Elanga's winner in that game was one of my favourite goals of the season.\nThe way he took it was really intelligent, because he had the option to pop the ball out to the left but the United back-line kept backing off, and he just kept on going. His finish was devastating too and, overall, it reminded me of me in my pomp with the way I used to drive up the pitch.\nIt's going to be harder for Aston Villa to make the top five, because they still have the Champions League and FA Cup to think about, but they are on a great run and, at the moment, they have the depth in the squad they need even if they make changes here before they face Paris-St Germain next week.\nI don't think Villa boss Unai Emery will prioritise any of the three competitions. They are in them all, so he will go for it in all three - and so he should.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nMychelle's prediction: I have not gone for a home win here - Villa will give them a good game, but Forest are playing so well. 0-1\nBrentford 0-0 Chelsea\nChelsea's issue has been consistency - they played well to beat Tottenham on Thursday but can they back it up here? I am not sure.\nBrentford are another team I have struggled to get right this season, but I'd always back them to score.\nI have feeling this is going to be an open game with a few goals. A win would be big for Chelsea in their push for a top-five finish, but I don't think they will get it.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nMychelle's prediction: Brentford are a good side but of course I am going to back Chelsea! We are a young team and I feel like we are improving all the time - I am really excited about next season but the target for now is to make the Champions League places and win the Europa Conference League, and I think we can do both. 1-2\nFulham 3-2 Liverpool\nFulham gave Liverpool a real test when they drew at Anfield earlier in the season.\nYes, Arne Slot's side had Andy Robertson sent off early on, but they were already a goal down by then. It took a huge effort for them to rescue a point with 10 men, but they have shown that kind of character plenty of times this season, to get something from a game when they have not played well.\nFulham made things difficult for Arsenal on Tuesday and I am expecting them to do the same here because they are very capable on the counter-attack.\nThey might even give Liverpool another big scare here but, with what is at stake, I still think the leaders will be fully focused and get the job done again, like they did against Everton.\nMohamed Salah against Fulham's Antonee Robinson will be a key battle, and maybe Salah will make the difference in the end - he is certainly due a big performance.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nMychelle's prediction: Fulham will give this a good go, but I don't think they can stop Liverpool's momentum. 1-3\nTottenham 3-1 Southampton\nIt was almost a big week for Southampton, who would have surpassed the Premier League's record lowest-points total, currently held by Robbie Savage's Derby County, if they had held on to beat Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nThey came agonisingly close and in many ways I would take a Saints victory here, just so I can enjoy hosting 606 with Robbie between now and the end of the season.\nYou will probably all have heard him recently, banging on about what a job he has done to take big-budget Macclesfield to promotion from the Northern Premier League, but I'd like to balance things a little bit with him hanging on to his record.\nI can't see Southampton taking three points here, though, even if the two other teams in the bottom three have already gone to Tottenham and won.\nSpurs won 5-0 at St Mary's before Christmas, in Russell Martin's final game as Saints boss.\nAnge Postecoglou's side are not playing well, so they won't score as many this time, but it should still be very comfortable for them and they might even keep a clean sheet.\nSutton's prediction: 3-0\nMychelle's prediction: I don't think Spurs are playing well enough to get another big scoreline here. 1-0\nOld Trafford, 16:30 BST\nManchester United are short of goals, and I don't understand why Ruben Amorim went with Joshua Zirkzee to lead their attack ahead of Rasmus Hojlund in Tuesday's defeat at Nottingham Forest.\nI see Hojlund as a number nine, while Zirkzee is a nine-and-a-half to a 10 - anything but a centre-forward. It cannot be helping Hojlund's confidence, because it is quite obvious Amorim doesn't fancy him when he is desperate for results and he is not picking him.\nPeople are saying United played well against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and they dominated the ball, but they looked a bigger threat when Harry Maguire came on at the end of the game.\nIs there a chance of big Harry playing up front from the start here? That would be funny, but it is not going to happen.\nManchester City will have to try something different in their attack too, with Erling Haaland out injured.\nThey have not clicked often enough this season, especially in the bigger games, and I still don't feel you can trust them to turn up the way they always used to - but this time I have a feeling they will find a way through.\nIf Amorim did manage to get the better of Pep Guardiola for a third time this season, then United would probably be selling T-shirts to mark the achievement. I don't see it happening though.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nMychelle's prediction: City have picked up a bit, and United are still quite inconsistent. 1-2\nLeicester 0-3 Newcastle\nLeicester should have been relegated immediately for what they did at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.\nFor a team who are desperate for a win, they showed absolutely zero attacking intent even when they went two goals down.\nAll they were interested in was building a wall and just stopping Manchester City. I felt sorry for their travelling fans because the team offered no threat whatsoever, and didn't even try to score.\nI can understand that everyone has a game plan but usually that changes when you go a goal or two behind. At 2-0, however, Leicester took their star striker, Jamie Vardy, off to put another midfielder on.\nThat tells you where Leicester are at right now - it felt like they were waving the white flag and going for damage limitation, rather than thinking they might as well give it a go and risk conceding more goals.\nWe know how nervy Manchester City have been this season, and Leicester caused them problems when they had a go at them at the King Power Stadium at the end of last year.\nThis time, there was none of that. They were pretty pathetic and you have got to question what their manager Ruud van Nistelrooy was thinking.\nHis team have lost their past seven league games and have not scored in any of them, and it is even longer since they managed a point or a league goal at home.\nThat is not going to change here. Newcastle got an important win over Brentford in midweek to show there was no hangover from their Carabao Cup celebrations.\nEven if they hit the hotel mini-bar again on Sunday night, it wouldn't matter - they would still beat Leicester.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nMychelle's prediction: I've gone for a shock here because I am really hoping Leicester do Chelsea a favour here by beating Newcastle. Surely they are going to sneak a goal at some point? 1-0", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg70lev3mz4o"}
