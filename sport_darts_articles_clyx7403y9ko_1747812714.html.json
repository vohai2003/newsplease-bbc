You've got to get through a tough field. I can't believe it.\"\nAfter bursting onto the scene at last year's World Championship, 'The Nuke' went on to win 10 titles and hit four nine-darters in 2024 and took that form to Alexandra Palace.\nLittler averaged more than 100 in five of his six matches and led the tournament with 76 maximums to win the Ballon D'Art trophy for top 180 hitter - although he did fail to match Michael Smith's record of 83 set in 2022.\nNot that Littler will care after a tournament where he was operating at a different level to the rest.\nThe relentless scoring is one thing, that magical double 10 he hardly misses is another, but Littler also has that perfect timing - hitting 180s and nailing big checkouts at crucial moments that just mentally grind his opponents into submission.\nA certain Phil Taylor won his first BDO world title 35 years ago this year, and there's more than a hint of 'The Power' about Littler's game.\nAt Littler's age, Taylor's record of 16 world titles could be in serious danger.\nVan Gerwen was once in Littler's shoes and beating up everyone on the big stage, but his third world title came back in 2019 and he has now lost three finals since then.\nThe Dutchman has won 157 PDC titles worldwide and is regarded as the best player since Taylor, but he has struggled in the last couple of years when he has failed to win a major in back-to-back seasons for the first time since his first in 2012.\nHe battled away against Littler but just did not have that extra gear, while Littler in return did just that, and \"every chance he got and every moment he had to hurt me, he did\".\n\"We all know I've come from a far distance and I've been battling my own game,\" admitted Van Gerwen on Sky Sports, who at twice Littler's age joked about the new star of the oche.\n\"I'm 35, he's 17. Every 17 years, a star gets born.\"\nVan Gerwen is not done yet, and just making the final after the year he had is a victory in itself, but Littler is going nowhere and everyone, Van Gerwen included, now needs to raise their game to keep up.\nIn truth, Littler's star was born at Alexandra Palace 12 months ago, but his continued brilliance has elevated him and his sport to new heights.\nSir Keir Starmer praised Littler on X for his \"mesmerising performance\" and labelled his victory as an \"inspirational performance under such pressure\" to win the title.\n\"You should be really proud of what you've achieved tonight,\" added the prime minister. \"Not just for yourself but for the sport of darts as a whole.\"\nLittler has gone from 164th to second in the PDC Order of Merit and added the world title to the Premier League, World Series and Grand Slam titles already won in 2024.\nOff the oche he has prompted a huge spike in darts interest among youngsters and brought the sport into the mainstream while winning the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and was runner-up in the main award to Olympic gold medal-winning athlete Keely Hodgkinson.\nNow a world champion, the sky's the limit for the natural born dartist who has the world at his finger tips.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/darts/articles/clyx7403y9ko"}
