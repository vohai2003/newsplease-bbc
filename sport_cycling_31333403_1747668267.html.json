I think he has made his decision not to entertain it,\" he said.\nCavendish, a two-time track world champion, has focused largely on road racing since riding in the Madison, now discontinued at Olympic level, in Beijing in 2008.\nChanges to the format of the omnium were believed to make that event attractive for a possible track return.\nBut while Sutton says \"the door is open for Cavendish\" he thinks time is running out for him to acquire the necessary qualification points.\nSutton added: \"There is no cut-off date. The road ends when he can't numerically qualify, simple as that. But if he doesn't put the points on the board he can't qualify.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/31333403"}
