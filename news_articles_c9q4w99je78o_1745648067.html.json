Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.\nA Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was \"cheap blackmail\" and a \"coup\" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.\nThe ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nThe internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages.\nThe first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.\nNegotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.\nPhase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years.\nHamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.\nAs the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods.\nIf, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.\nWitkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.\nWitkoff is said by Israel to have proposed the temporary extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war.\nA statement from Netanyahu's office said: \"With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease.\n\"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.\"\nThe Hamas spokesman said: \"Netanyahu's decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation... The international community must apply pressure on the Israeli government to stop starving our people.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q4w99je78o"}
