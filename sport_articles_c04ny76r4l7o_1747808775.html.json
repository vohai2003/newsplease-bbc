Goedert has already shown that in the play-offs and leads the Eagles in catches, targets, receiving yards and big plays.\nAnd once he gets the ball he is so hard to stop, as he has compiled 123 yards after the catch during this play-off run.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c04ny76r4l7o"}
