We have been on a difficult run but they helped us and gave us the energy to stay competing and ready for that battle.\n\"We know we are a small team, we can see that when we lined up at the beginning but I thought our boys did very well. They were organised and competed well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ckgzg29e99jt"}
