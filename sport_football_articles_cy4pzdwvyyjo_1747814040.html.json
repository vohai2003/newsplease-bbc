They were not.\n\"It's unsatisfying that it takes longer and longer and longer, and we are trying to find solutions.\n\"We didn't find the right ones and that's why it takes longer and longer.\n\"If you have problems in the hip area, it's a very complex area, you have many muscles, the groin, the pubis. It's not always just one part.\n\"Now we have to deal with these issues and, of course, we all hope and are doing our best to get him back.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy4pzdwvyyjo"}
