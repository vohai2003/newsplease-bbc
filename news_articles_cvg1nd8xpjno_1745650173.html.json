I am greatly complimented by this kind thought and accept your offer with gratitude\n\"I shall always value the picture not only in itself but also for the feelings so gracefully expressed in your letter.\"\nIn reply, Lord Saltoun wrote: \"I was sure that your sensitive ear and taste must have suffered and suffer even more and more often than my own, I ventured to offer it (the painting), and as I said before, I hope it may bring you good fortune.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg1nd8xpjno"}
