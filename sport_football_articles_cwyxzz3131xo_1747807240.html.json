We did not take advantage of the chances and we have to improve the little details. We are in a moment where this unlucky thing [the first goal] happens.\n\"The second goal was a big knock for us. The third goal was from one counter-attack. For all of their goals, we can do better. After we scored, we had good moments again but it is not enough. It is a pity.\n\"We regained a lot of balls but the little details and individual actions played against us. The message [to the players] is if you don't take your chances and score, they will win the match.\n\"The first goal was lucky for them, the second goal was big quality but even then we can do better. We have to improve with the moments we have and also be more solid.\n\"I think we did very good things, even if it is difficult to say when you lose 4-1.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyxzz3131xo"}
