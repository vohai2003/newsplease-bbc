You can see what it's like when this place gets going and I was proud to be standing there as the head coach.\n\"It was about the team today. We had a difficult week - where three players (Lars-Jorgen Salvesen, Ryan Nyambe and Ben Osborn) who would have started but were injured through the week - and the group turned up yesterday and we had a new game plan.\n\"It's obviously an emotional day for everyone and it was a great effort by the fans, the players - this is the Derby County family and whatever happens from now until the end of the season we're going to build something special.\n\"I'm just glad we won a football game, it doesn't matter who it was against because it was really important that we show everyone that we are fully committed and want to do well for this football club.\"\nBlackburn Rovers head coach Valerien Ismael told BBC Radio Lancashire:\n\"I think the players are really disappointed about the result, they wanted it and maybe too much.\n\"We lost the game in the first seven minutes. We knew exactly what we would face, everything was set and I think that the first seven minutes was very difficult to manage.\n\"We had an injury (to Augustus Kargbo) and after that we changed the shape. It was much better, we had more control and had great chances, with Yuki to come back into the game earlier, and the goal from Pape [Gueye] after that gave us that momentum for the second half\n\"But the second half we were under control, it is clear, but Derby for sure played the game to waste time, to slow down the process, which is normal.\n\"But we were not very dangerous and I expected more crosses, more penetration, more shots on target and that is something we need to work on and learn from to do better next time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c5y9qyy0xvnt"}
