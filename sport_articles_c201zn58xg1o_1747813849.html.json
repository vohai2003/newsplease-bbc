The players have been excellent, they made me feel comfortable. The experience was great for me and Craig Clark (assistant) as well.\n\"Just disappointed we concede that goal at that end. I'll have to digest that as time goes on and then reflect on the game.\n\"There's been a lot of success in the past four seasons. We need to try and maintain that. There will be bumps in the road.\n\"It's up to the board what they decide and what they're looking for, the profile for the manager. They have a great bunch of players staying on for the next manager.\n\"He's got a good group, a good core, and that will help the next manager hugely.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c201zn58xg1o"}
