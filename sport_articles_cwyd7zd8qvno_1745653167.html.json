We can't seem to hold on to a lead, and maybe we should think of strengthening the defence over the long term.\nRyan: Two horrendous mistakes by big Richard Taylor, who has otherwise been tremendous this season, derailed what looked like another masterclass from Stephen Robinson.\nExtremely frustrating and symptomatic of the season, looking probable that we will miss out on top six unless we can pull it out the bag in the next five games.\nW: Two very obvious mistakes in defence led to two goals, but we tend to forget the mistakes made up front which were good opportunities and were missed.\nOverall it was a tight performance, we actually were probably better than Hearts for large chunks of the game, but you can't give easy ball away to reasonable players and then not expect to get hurt.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cwyd7zd8qvno"}
