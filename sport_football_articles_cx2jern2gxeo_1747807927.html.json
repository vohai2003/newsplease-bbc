Any side that finishes 25th or below after eight gameweeks will be eliminated.\nManchester City, European champions in 2023, currently occupy 25th spot, but with Stuttgart in 24th entertaining Paris Saint-Germain in 22nd next week in a winner-takes-all clash, that gives City a route into the play-offs.\nIf City win at home to Club Brugge, then Pep Guardiola's side will scrape into the play-offs. If they draw or lose to Club Brugge, City will be out and their European campaign will be all over before the end of January.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2jern2gxeo"}
