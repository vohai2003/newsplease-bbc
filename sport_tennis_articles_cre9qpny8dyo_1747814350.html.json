It's a great feeling.\n\"As I spend more time on clay I'm beginning to like it more and more. I'm building my relationship with the surface.\"\nAfter reaching the Miami Open quarter-finals in March and moving back inside the world's top 50, Raducanu chose to take a \"physical and mental\" break from competitive action.\nThat meant she did not begin her clay court swing until a month later in Madrid.\nA second-round exit in the Spanish capital was followed by last week's run to the Italian Open fourth round, where she managed to win three clay-court matches in a row for the first time in her career.\nVictory over Kasatkina was another indication the Briton is hitting her stride at the ideal time before her second French Open campaign begins.\nThe players exchanged breaks of serve in a scrappy start to the match but, after being gifted a second game by Kasatkina, Raducanu took charge.\nA hold of serve without reply allowed her to grow in confidence and she was soon dictating play with punishing, powerful groundstrokes.\nTaking full advantage of her opponent's continued struggles on serve, Raducanu reeled off five consecutive games to win her first set in four meetings with Kasatkina.\nThe second set was not straightforward. Raducanu's opening hold of serve proved invaluable as it was followed by a run of seven consecutive breaks, with former world number eight Kasatkina digging in.\nRaducanu could not hide her delight after unleashing a superb backhand down the line to close in on victory, eventually ending Kasatkina's resistance with her fourth match point.\nRaducanu reached the second round in her only previous Roland Garros appearance in 2022.\nThe 2021 US Open champion is currently working with Mark Petchey - a former coach of Andy Murray - on an informal basis, having been without a full-time coach since January.\nElsewhere on Monday, fellow Briton Harriet Dart was knocked out in the first round of French Open qualifying, losing 6-1 6-2 to Ukrainian 21-year-old Anastasiya Soboleva.\nHeather Watson and Francesca Jones will begin their bids to join Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the main draw on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cre9qpny8dyo"}
