So now we're in this situation and we're chuffed to pieces.\n\"It shows the quality we have within our squad and how good we are.\n\"It means more than anything. It's something we wanted to do going into the game. We just wanted to win and that was what we've done. Now we've put ourselves in a very good situation.\"\nWhen asked if he believes Rangers can go all the way to the final like they did in 2022, he said: \"Yeah. Definitely. 100%.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czrlkvpenylo"}
