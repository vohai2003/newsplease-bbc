But we all know that it won't be like that,\" says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26.\n\"I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now.\"\n\"I think the Brandmauer will stay,\" says Dominic, 30, who voted for the AfD in Saxony. \"I want the government to really think about their own people and their own country.\"\nPressure to take down the long-standing firewall is not just coming from the AfD, but from leading figures in the Trump administration too, including US Vice-President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who has repeatedly backed the party.\nMost of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany.\nThey won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length.\nThat is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached.\nOne mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him.\nProf Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally.\n\"If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time.\"\nOn a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: \"Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD.\"\nGermany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections.\nHer repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile.\nBut it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants.\nTackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape.\nUnderlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus SÃ¶der said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was \"in fact, the last bullet of democracy\".\nThere is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment.\nAnd the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and \"the European idea\".\nThat was incompatible, he said, with the conservatives' \"core DNA\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy9dl4drr8lo"}
