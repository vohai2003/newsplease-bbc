They were on a superb run of form until the start of May, but have lost their past two games.\nIt is Palace who will have all the momentum and Eberechi Eze is flying at the moment so I am going to back them here, but the outcome really depends on whether their manager Oliver Glasner makes a lot of changes.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx27yk53nn4o"}
