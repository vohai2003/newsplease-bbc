Since then, both have been involved in goal-laden games, which whets the appetite for this encounter.\nHibs are front-runners to finish third - quite the turnaround since November when they were bottom.\nOnly Celtic - in the league and Scottish Cup - have beaten them in the interim as David Gray's side have amassed 10 league wins and five draws.\nThey are also scoring goals for fun - 48 in the Premiership.\nRangers, on the other hand, are leaking goals. They've conceded 12 under interim head coach Barry Ferguson, who bemoaned \"old habits\" after the win at Dundee.\nThe former Ibrox captain is yet to enjoy an Ibrox victory since replacing Philippe Clement, but did celebrate a penalty shootout triumph over Fenerbahce in the Europa League.\nThe table is set, the ingredients are in place, it's over to Rangers and Hibs to serve up another football feast.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c7931xzvlldo"}
