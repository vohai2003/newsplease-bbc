In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda.\nThe deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK's government.\nDR Congo's government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda.\nLast week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe.\nThe US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda's support for M23.\nAlso sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said.\nResponding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions were \"unjustified\".\nThe M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state.\nThe rebels have captured eastern DR Congo's two biggest cities, Goma and Bukavu.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8y5j49xgyo"}
