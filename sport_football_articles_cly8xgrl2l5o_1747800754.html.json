It cannot be helping Hojlund's confidence, because it is quite obvious Amorim doesn't fancy him when he is desperate for results and he is not picking him.\nPeople are saying United played well against Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and they dominated the ball, but they looked a bigger threat when Harry Maguire came on at the end of the game.\nIs there a chance of big Harry playing up front from the start here? That would be funny, but it is not going to happen.\nManchester City will have to try something different in their attack too, with Erling Haaland out injured.\nThey have not clicked often enough this season, especially in the bigger games, and I still don't feel you can trust them to turn up the way they always used to - but this time I have a feeling they will find a way through.\nIf Amorim did manage to get the better of Pep Guardiola for a third time this season, then United would probably be selling T-shirts to mark the achievement. I don't see it happening though.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly8xgrl2l5o"}
