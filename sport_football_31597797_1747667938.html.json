We didn't pass the ball how we set out to go and play. We didn't keep possession.\n\"Notts County did to us what we were expecting to do to them.\n\"It's a massive disappointment, but we've got to be better. Disappointment's not a good thing to have, because you've got regrets about what happened on the pitch.\n\"People are shouting there's no passion, but the players gave it a go. It wasn't great, but I wouldn't say anybody didn't try out there. Everything we set out to do just didn't happen.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31597797"}
