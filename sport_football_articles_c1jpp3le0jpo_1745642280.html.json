We didn't have one under [Julen] Lopetegui earlier this season, it just felt like the players didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing.\n\"Potter has come in and it just seems like he has put the players in the positions they should be in. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a key example, he's been brilliant in the last two games just playing a very traditional wing-back role. That's one of the most impressive things that West Ham fans have liked under Potter, he has come in and just gone back to basics.\n\"It's clear that the players have bought into his ideas, going away to Arsenal and winning and then a routine win last night is evidence that we are definitely heading in the right direction again.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1jpp3le0jpo"}
