Their goal was an exceptional goal from John McGovern which turned the game.\n\"We let them back into it second half and it was just about finding a way as it has been the last few weeks. We needed the goal at that stage, Dungannon were pressing really hard and our winner came against the run of play, but it's points over performance at this time of the season.\"\nOn pushing to finish second: \"It's crazy we're only five points off second place again and we just want to finish the season as high as we can.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cq5wg22xzyvo"}
