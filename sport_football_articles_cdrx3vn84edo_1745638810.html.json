It's not as if they carved through us, it was just basics,\" said Neil.\nMillwall have won just one of their past five league games as well as going out of the FA Cup to Crystal Palace at the weekend.\n\"We lacked cutting edge,\" the Scot added.\n\"The biggest frustration is the basics cost us the game without Bristol (City) having to do too much.\n\"I thought we were better in the second half, so that's frustrating. We can't dwell on it too much, I don't think we did much wrong.\"\nMillwall visit Watford in the Championship on Saturday before a trip to leaders Leeds United next Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cdrx3vn84edo"}
