The close seasons seem to get shorter year on year so the new gaffer needs as much time as possible to get his squad assembled and in shape for what will be a difficult season.\nWe have a new pitch to pay for and having lost money again this year it seems certain the player budget will be reduced.\nHopefully we employ a manager with a wide range of contacts and who is willing to give our youth players a chance.\nThe oustanding highlight of the season is easy - the trip to Bruges with 3000 fellow fans felt like a once-in-a-lifetime experience.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c9q0073vex4o"}
