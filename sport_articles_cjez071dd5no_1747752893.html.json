Four or five goals was the most common prediction.\nDjurgarden of Sweden or Luzern of Switzerland await in the next round, but both manager Lee Johnson and captain Paul Hanlon spoke of expecting a different, more direct challenge from the Andorrans and that had some Hibs fans worried, although they expect to outscore the opposition.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjez071dd5no"}
