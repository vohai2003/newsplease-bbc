It makes you wonder if it was all pointless.\n\"But I think it's still important for Ukrainians to see support from the Western world.\"\nBen's work takes him to vulnerable towns and villages where he delivers everything from food and sanitary products to pet supplies for animal shelters.\nHe also brings toys and treats for children, delivers vehicles and supports rehabilitation centres for veterans.\nBen said his latest trip was not just about delivering aid but also about showing people in Ukraine they had not been forgotten.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4n8pye9lno"}
