But why not dare to dream? We can carry this journey on,\" said John McGinn in the glow of their Champions League win over Club Brugge a fortnight ago.\nJust as much as the supporters, the Villa players must be itching to get on with their season.\nHaving on several occasions during the winter looked in need of a pause to reboot their campaign, Villa had discovered some momentum before the last-16 second leg victory, so perhaps the break came just when they did not need it.\nA squad that has defied gravity at times over the past two years now looks stronger than at any previous stage this season â€“ pending an update from Unai Emery tomorrow, Ross Barkley is the only player out through injury, although Ollie Watkins had a minor issue in the Brugge match.\nArguably, given the depth compared to great Villa teams of the past, Emery is overseeing the strongest squad in the club's history. At the risk of too much hyperbole, if the next few weeks go well, they could represent a major milestone in that proud history.\nThey are not in Paris yet.\nVilla fans who take in every away game have nearly 600 miles of travelling to do in the next week - Preston and Brighton, before the equally significant home game against Nottingham Forest.\nBut Villa go into this period with interest in three competitions and a realistic chance of achieving something significant in all of them. Manchester City's presence notwithstanding, the FA Cup has rarely looked as wide open as this. Premier League form has been patchy but the gap to the top five is still small.\nThen there is Europe.\nMany bookmakers make Villa seventh favourites for the Champions League. But none of the more fancied runners have been unbeatable this season and all carry a greater pressure of expectation. This would have seemed a wild claim even a few months ago, never mind two or three years back, but, it is not ludicrous to imagine Villa advancing further, even to the final.\nEmery has often urged fans not to look too far ahead - to enjoy the journey. He is right, but for Villa fans the last fortnight must have felt like Christmas Eve every day.\n\"You never ever know,\" said McGinn, thinking of Paris and beyond, \"stranger things have happened.\"\nYes, John, but one dream at a time.\nListen to full commentary of Preston v Aston Villa at 13:30 BST on Sunday on BBC Radio WM (all frequencies)", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce34dpnqklqo"}
