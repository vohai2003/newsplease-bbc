Great win and everyone is giving 100 per cent.\nFraser: When we play Rangers or Celtic - with historical stats - it's always a nervy one, a game that most 'Well fans just hope we put up a fight and do ourselves justice and we did that, there was composure - using our midfield, playing through, tracking and pressing. Proud of the team. Well done, let's keep it going.\nNorrie: Superb as my old dad would say. Pressed well in the first half and a deserved the two goal lead. Worked hard second half and substitutes helped keep up the energy. Hung in there for a deserved win.\nRoss: It's truly amazing what a change of manager and tactics can do to lift a club, its players and supporters. It's early days but it's a really positive start for Michael Wimmer at our club. We were well worthy of our three points, the only way is up as they say.\nRyan: What a manager Wimmer is. Night and day the tactics under previous who shall not be named.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cqldzxlv4xqo"}
