Get goals early, put them to bed, take the three points and off you go, move on to the next one. But we find it a struggle,\" he said.\n\"If I'm really honest, Ipswich should have got more points than they got [at the Amex]. Southampton should have done the same, certainly so we need to up it a little bit at home.\n\"The fans are there for them, making noise. It's up to the players now to up their game and we'll see if they can get started on Saturday against Everton to get a roll going on the home games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce9nv2gg7r8o"}
