We miss a good creative player who can beat a player and pick out a decisive pass. That aside Killie continue to be a bogey team for us, and playing on a plastic pitch doesn't help!\nIan: Very disappointing. The opposition don't do much to win games against Saints we conspire to lose games - plain and simple. Two avoidable penalties. Back to square one and not looking likely to win any of our next few games.\nDouglas S: Absolutely a dire performance today and Stephen Robinson must take some of the blame. The team selection was wrong. When I saw Jonah Ayunga in the starting XI I feared the worst and when he started the second half I couldn't believe it. Then Mikael Mandron comes on.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2vzjr42v0o"}
