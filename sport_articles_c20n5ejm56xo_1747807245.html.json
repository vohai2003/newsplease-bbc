David Gray's side left Aberdeen's Pittodrie with all three points on Saturday - their third win in four league games.\nHearts moved off the foot of the table and sent St Johnstone bottom by beating the Perth side 2-1 at home on Sunday. European games may have been a distraction for Neil Critchley's side this season but it is just domestic games from here on in.\nVictory for the hosts and they will move above David Gray's Hibs. Should the Easter Road side win, they will increase the gap between the teams to five points. Four of the past five meetings have ended drawn and the last two wins in the fixture have been by a solitary goal.\nTo save their league season, both teams really need to be pushing into the top six and Thursday's game could be just the springboard if one of them can pick up all three points.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c20n5ejm56xo"}
