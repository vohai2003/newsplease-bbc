Second half was more open, they came more into it, but we had some really good chances.\n\"Ultimately the score is 2-1 to us and we deserved to win over 90 minutes but the injury-time equaliser was a kick in the stomach for us.\n\"Then to score again so soon afterwards is something the lads have been talking about â€“ we don't score many late goals.\n\"It was brilliant movement in the box from Molumby. I felt over the 97 minutes we deserved to win the game. I am pleased for the fans. We just have to keep going.\"\nMowbray on Bartley's post-match red card: \"I didn't know until he came in and said he'd had a red card.\n\"It's really disappointing and frustrating for us. I think he's going to be really important for the team. It's going to be a blow if he's going to miss three games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg87jn4xv7o"}
