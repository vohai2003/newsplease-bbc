This season, League One clubs Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Dumbarton have been put into administration, with others having struggling to make ends meet.\nThere is also a growing number of teams wishing to join the pyramid set-up, with the current Highland/Lowland league format likely to change.\nIt could be there is are new East, West and Northern Leagues with the three winners playing a round-robin competition for the right to play the bottom club in League Two for a place in the SPFL.\nReducing the Premiership to 10 teams would mean clubs playing 36 games compared to the current 38, with each team meeting four times and no split.\nHowever, it's hard to envisage that gaining enough support from clubs, given they could be voting themselves out of the elite.\nA 14 or 16-team top flight are also possibilities, with a number of options regarding splits likely to be under consideration.\nHowever that would mark the most radical change in a generation and would need the majority of clubs to agree.\nIt would also need the support of the broadcast partners, who pour millions of pounds into the SPFL.\nIn the main, Sky Sports would be looking to ensure that four Old Firm fixtures remain part of the calendar. And that would be unlikely with a bigger top league.\nIt was previously thought unlikely that the SPFL would ask fans for their thoughts on reconstruction, but that stance has shifted.\nStuart Murphy, chief executive of the Scottish Football Supporters' Association told Good Morning Scotland that supporters will be involved in discussions.\n\"I've had a conversation this morning. Fans will be consulted, which is a sea change - one that we welcome.\n\"It's potentially a really big day in the Scottish football landscape. The Working Group will meet to float ideas and proposals which they will then take back to clubs.\n\"When we have done research at the SFSA, it is overwhelming that fans want bigger leagues.\"\nWhether the SPFL listen to those fans or not is another issue.\nThe voting structure within the SPFL can look quite complicated and could, of course, change. Although there would likely need to be a vote to force that...\nAs it stands, for anything to be voted through, a proposal needs the backing of:\n11 of the 12 Premiership clubs\n8 of the 10 in the Championship\n15 of the 20 in Leagues 1 and 2\nIf any of the above does not happen then, as things stand, no change to the current structure can be made.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2ydg7gp9ko"}
