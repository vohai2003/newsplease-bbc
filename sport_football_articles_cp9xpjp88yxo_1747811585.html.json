The Cherries hit the woodwork twice and they were unlucky to lose in the end.\nI can see Everton making a few changes here, because they play Liverpool in the rearranged Merseyside derby on Wednesday.\nAfter three straight wins, Everton manager David Moyes will still want a good performance to keep the momentum going, but I am going to stick with my policy of backing Bournemouth.\nThe Cherries have already beaten Everton twice this season - first with that incredible finish to their game in August, when they came back from being 2-0 down after 87 minutes to win 3-2, and then at the start of January when they won 1-0 in Sean Dyche's last game as Toffees boss.\nI would love Andoni Iraola to go strong in the FA Cup this season and go all out to win it - the possibility is there, even with their current injury problems.\nOn that basis, I am going for them to get the better of Everton again, and make it a hat-trick of wins over them.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp9xpjp88yxo"}
