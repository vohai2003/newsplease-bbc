I always admire people who do that.\nDavies has signed a few players from north of the border for the Blues, and also spent more than Â£10m on Jay Stansfield from Fulham in August.\nThat is a bit of clout for a League One club to have, but Birmingham wanted to go straight back up after being relegated last season, and it looks like it will pay off.\nThis is a shot to nothing for them against Newcastle, and I think they will give them a good game - but I am going with Newcastle to come out on top.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy5k29vwkeyo"}
