He took that job in January 2024, with Eastbourne 21st, and steered them to safety.\nHe has also managed Mansfield Town and Boston United, as well as having two spells as caretaker manager at Barnsley.\nIn addition to a season with Harriers in 2003-04, Murray's playing career also took in Derby County, Notts County, Burton Albion, Mansfield, Carlisle United, Torquay United, Macclesfield Town, Oxford United and Luton Town.\nBrown was sacked a fortnight ago after defeat by Southport on the final day of the season cost Kidderminster the National League North title, and they then lost to Chester in the play-off semi-finals.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9vggyn7wxyo"}
