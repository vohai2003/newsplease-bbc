This winless spell includes two losses in two trips to Hibs (2-1 in 2009-10, 1-0 in 2019-20).\nSt Mirren boss Steve Robinson has never won away to Hibs as a manager in the Scottish Premiership in eight previous attempts (D2 L6); itâ€™s the joint-most he has faced a side away from home in the competition as a manager without winning (also 8 v Celtic). Robinson has also never won an opening game in the top flight home or away in his managerial career (P5 D1 L4).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cv21e9wern8o"}
