But if you get good for a few games in a World Cup, that's all it can take.\n\"So we've got three or four really tough games, but it's a challenge I'm looking forward to.\"\nRussell, who played his club rugby in France with Racing 92 last season but will join Bath in the English Premiership after the World Cup, is relishing the chance to play again after a long break.\nScotland face South Africa on 10 September before games against Tonga, pool outsiders Romania and finally Six Nations Grand Slam winners Ireland.\nThe British and Irish Lions playmaker is well aware Gregor Townsend's side must hit the ground running when the tournament begins in France next month.\n\"These next three games will be really important for myself and for the team to get back into it, after eight weeks that I've not played,\" added Russell.\n\"I might play well straight away, I'm not sure, but after having eight weeks off it's very different going from training to a Test match against the number two team in the world.\n\"I'm not sure what team France are going to put out, but even if it's not their strongest team, they've got really good strength and depth, so it's always going to be a really tough match.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/66365191"}
