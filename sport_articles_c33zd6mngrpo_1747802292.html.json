He adds: \"Tynecastle is one of the best away days in the league, the atmosphere tends to be good, it can be a very hostile venue in terms of the supporters.\"\nGoodwin praises his squad and says they've put themselves \"in a really strong position\" before the split.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c33zd6mngrpo"}
