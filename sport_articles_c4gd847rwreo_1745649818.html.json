The expected response from the players simply did not materialise.\nOnce again, they failed to deliver.\nThis is a storyline that has been regurgitated way too often and having now lost three consecutive matches at Ibrox, to Queens Park, St Mirren and now Motherwell, serious questions must surely be being asked within the club.\nThere will be questions about the Cyriel Dessers VAR decision but, in truth, the level of performance was not good enough.\nFerguson called for his players to be dominant and stamp their authority but they were inexplicably flat. Duals were lost. Passing was slack. Poor, poor errors made.\nWith a trip to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbache to follow, Rangers will simply hope the team that competes so well at Europa League level, turns up.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c4gd847rwreo"}
