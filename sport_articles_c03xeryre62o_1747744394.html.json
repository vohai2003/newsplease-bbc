There’s always a little bit of stress but that makes me show up and concentrate.\n“I never thought my debut would be at Easter Road in a game like that, it felt amazing. The fans were really good and helped me and the team a lot which was important.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c03xeryre62o"}
