And two of them came before the fifth-minute goal.\nNow their focus is down to the Premier League - where they sit fourth - and the Uefa Conference League.\nTheir priority will be getting back into the Champions League, but Europe's tertiary tournament gives them their only chance of winning a first trophy of any note since the Fifa Club World Cup in February 2022.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgmydnyjr9zo"}
