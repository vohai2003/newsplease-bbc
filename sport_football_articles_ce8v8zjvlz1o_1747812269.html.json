It starts with us having to win. We have to be in distance with those three games.\n\"We know the finish Manchester United have so there is an opportunity in my opinion. We don't get that opportunity if we don't get the points in the Brighton games and the subsequent league fixtures.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8v8zjvlz1o"}
