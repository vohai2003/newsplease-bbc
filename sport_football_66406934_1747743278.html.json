Not only because he's a good player but also because he's a leader. You can hear his voice. He's talking with everybody. When you have this kind of player on the pitch, it's a boost for the manager.\n\"We are still waiting to see how he improves. Then we can finally have an idea about the time. That's why we don't know the timing because they are still analysing the situation.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66406934"}
