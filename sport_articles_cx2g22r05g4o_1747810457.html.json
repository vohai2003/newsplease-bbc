We need to own this defeat and learn from it. We came here to win and to test ourselves and we weren't at a good enough level today. There's no point in feeling frustrated or angry because we didn't play well enough.\n\"We did not ask enough questions from the opponent. When we play like we played it was almost impossible today. We made the right decisions but maybe the execution was not there.\n\"Yes I'm frustrated for the players because they want to show they are good players and I know they are good players.\n\"We have a big, big fight ahead of us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2g22r05g4o"}
