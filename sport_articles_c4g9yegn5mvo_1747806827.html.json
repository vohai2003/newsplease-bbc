He's a little bit older (35) so that recovery's huge.\n\"Now he's just had another week off so I feel like he's going to be well rested, ready to roll and absolutely dominate once again.\n\"Those wheels will be turning, they're going to be fresh, and if you get a fresh Travis Kelce, he can do some serious damage to the defence.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g9yegn5mvo"}
