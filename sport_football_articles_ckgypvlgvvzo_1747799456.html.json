For example, Trent Alexander-Arnold is out at the moment, but Conor Bradley can come in at right-back - problem solved.\nI am speaking before they play Tottenham in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, but even defeat there would not derail their season. They have dropped points here and there, but unlike every other team at the top of the Premier League, they have not had a dodgy period.\nWhatever team that Slot puts out here, my feeling is that Liverpool are pretty unstoppable. They have this relentless nature, and they will find a way of beating Plymouth.\nSutton's prediction: 1-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckgypvlgvvzo"}
