St Johnstone got into our half once. But we didn't have enough creativity.\n\"We should draw that game, and the games we should be drawing, we're losing. That's why we are where we are at the moment, in limbo. We've not cemented anything in the top six and we're still looking over our shoulder. The reason for that is huge inconsistency from one week to the next.\n\"I didn't think we had enough invention and I take ultimate responsibility for that. We've got to force the game and make something happen and we haven't been able to do that. I've obviously picked the wrong team.\n\"It's hard, after you win 3-0 with such a convincing performance at Aberdeen, to make changes. But that's what's needed in certain games so, that's totally my fault.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crm7l3xzy31o"}
