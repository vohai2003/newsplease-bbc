I don't think we played as well as we did against Liverpool.\n\"Tonali has a thunderbolt of a strike when he does go for goal. I am mightily relieved to see it hit the net.\n\"Always after the international break the games are different. We had players in different physical moments and we looked to have picked up a few minor injuries but hopefully nothing to keep anyone out of the next game.\n\"We are relieved to come through with the three points.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c209nxvelyeo"}
