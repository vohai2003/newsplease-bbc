They just have, Yokohama, Athletic (Bilbao).\n\"We get those chances in the first 15 minutes and should have scored. If it's an international team, Celtic are 2-0 down.\n\"Our shape and system were good, our discipline were good, and we give away a stupid penalty. Then we don't defend a cross in the last minute of the first half and next minute we are 3-0 down at half-time.\n\"I know at 3-0 here that can go on to become six or seven. My challenge for them at half-time was to be brave and go and score a goal and press high.\n\"Sometimes we were able to do it and sometimes we didn't because we have some new players who aren't quite there with the explanations I give them but I was really happy with how brave they were in the second half.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4n0500q344o"}
