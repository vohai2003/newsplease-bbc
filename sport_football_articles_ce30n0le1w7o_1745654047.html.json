It's a fight for second place now.\nRob: We shouldn't be too disheartened by that result. We played really well for the majority of the game but in the end they showed their quality.\nIf we play like that for the rest of the season we'll be promoted.\nLes: 1-0 lead and sat back with players tiring but different class with strikers that take their chances and strikers that don't.\nTrying to hold on to a 1-0 lead against a good side doesn't work.\nSean: We looked like the Premier League team that got relegated last season the way we played on the final 20 minutes.\nA chilling reminder of our best and worst in two halves.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce30n0le1w7o"}
