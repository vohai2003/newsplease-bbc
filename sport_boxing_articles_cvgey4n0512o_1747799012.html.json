But he has now not won since beating Denzel Bentley in Manchester in November 2023 to win the Lonsdale Belt.\nIn the immediate wake of Saturday's defeat Heaney said he had considered his future in the ring, but he is now only looking forward.\n\"I will carry on,\" he told Talksport. \"I almost thought to myself is this it? Was that my own last dance without even knowing it?\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cvgey4n0512o"}
