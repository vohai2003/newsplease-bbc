We were so dominant in that second half and we had various chances to get that second goal.\n\"I feel to go out with nine points and a goal difference of three is difficult to take but that's the way it is. I've got to take the positives from that into the league campaign.\n\"There are loads of positives to take, the only negative is that we've not progressed.\n\"There is definitely room for improvement and things we can work on but if we perform like we did in that second half, with that intensity, I think we'll be okay.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4n004v5vd6o"}
