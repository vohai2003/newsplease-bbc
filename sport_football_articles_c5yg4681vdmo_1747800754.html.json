It took a huge effort for them to rescue a point with 10 men, but they have shown that kind of character plenty of times this season - to get something from a game when they have not played well.\nFulham made things difficult for Arsenal on Tuesday and I am expecting them to do the same here because they are very capable on the counter-attack.\nThey might even give Liverpool another big scare here but, with what is at stake, I still think the leaders will be fully focused and get the job done again, like they did against Everton.\nMohamed Salah against Fulham's Antonee Robinson will be a key battle, and maybe Salah will make the difference in the end. He is certainly due a big performance.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yg4681vdmo"}
