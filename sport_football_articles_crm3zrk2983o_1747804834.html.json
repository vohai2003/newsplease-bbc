Here are some of your comments:\nSimon: Marshall Munetsi and Emmanuel Agbadou have been fantastic January transfer window signings. Joao Gomes and Andre have really gelled and protecting that back three, with Matt Doherty on the right and Toti Gomes on the left, has allowed Nelson Semedo and Rayan Ait-Nouri to be free.\nMolly: Why is everyone apparently so resigned to Matheus Cunha's departure? Why are we not fighting to keep all our brilliant Brazilians? What a team we could be. Back the team or sell the club, Fosun.\nSimon: Semedo's expiring contract.\nNick Strand Larsen's goal record is massively going under the radar. For a first season, 10 goals is a good haul and provides a platform to move forward next season. That's the same amount as Raul Jimenez at Fulham and three off his first season at Wolves.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crm3zrk2983o"}
