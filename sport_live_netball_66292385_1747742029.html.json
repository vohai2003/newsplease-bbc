Netball is a semi-contact sport, so men and women and boys and girls can all play on the same side. There's also a strong sense of friendship and team-bonding within netball teams.\nFind your netball position from how you use your phone\nTake a listen to the NetballersPodcastfor more insights about all levels of netball.\nWhat to expect when I start?\nNetball is an all over body workout so is great for losing weight and improving muscle tone.\nYou don't need any special kit, just clothes that you feel comfortable exercising in and trainers.\nYou move through the court by running and jumping so it helps with balance and co-ordination.\nWalking Netball, external is growing in popularity and is a low-impact way to play the game with no age limits - younger or older!\nDisability Netball is similar to the traditional game but with a few adaptations such as using a ball with a bell inside for people with visual impairments or installing an induction loop for those who are hearing-impaired.
