I haven't seen the Chiefs blow out anybody all season. Unfortunately, I've witnessed first hand that the Eagles can blow out teams, so if the Chiefs can't contain Barkley, Hurts and the Eagles' receiving corps early, I think it's going to be very tough.\n\"Mahomes is obviously a magician who is able to win games, so can dig them out of that hole.\n\"It's going to be an interesting game. I think Barkley is going to be one of the deciding factors, but at this point, I think it's going to be very hard to bet against Mahomes, so it's 50-50.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cr7ex287ekzo"}
