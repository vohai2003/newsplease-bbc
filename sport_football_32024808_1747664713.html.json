His fear is that England will drift into international football obscurity if nothing is done and he wants to be the man to do it.\n\"Dyke has always been a populist and these proposals will chime with many England fans. But the acid test is how they are received by Premier League clubs.\n\"They will have to vote for the reforms by a two-thirds majority for them to come into effect. Dyke will argue that there are more Harry Kanes and Ryan Masons ready to come through the system if only the Premier League clubs can clear a pathway for them.\"\nCurrently, players must have played at least 75% of their country's internationals over the past two years. That will now change according to ranking. Players must play at least 30% of matches in the last two years if their country is in the top 10, 45% if ranked between 11th and 20th, 60% between 21st and 30th and 75% if between 31st and 50th.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32024808"}
