They weren't expected to win today.\n\"If they can get a few weeks training under their belt and get a few players freshened up and injury-free, they can still be knocking around an All-Ireland quarter-final.\n\"Once you get to that stage, anything can happen. It's a tight group, it's a close group. They've been through good days and difficult days.\n\"I have no doubt, I'll back that group that they'll come back.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czx1kreg1pvo"}
