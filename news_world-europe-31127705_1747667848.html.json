Police said his clothing helped him survive the freezing temperatures.\n\"His life is not in danger,\" police said.\nThe American's rescue came after 11 off-piste skiers were killed in avalanches in the Swiss Alps over a period of four days, following heavy snow-fall.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31127705"}
