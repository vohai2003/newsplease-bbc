The Northern Irish outfit are yet to make it into the group-stages of a continental competition.\nThe Crues finished fifth in the NIFL Premiership last season, with Philip Lowry bagging 17 goals along the way.\nAs for Rosenborg, they've enjoyed many a European run... and the odd meeting with a Scottish side. They made the group-stages of the Europa League in 2019-20 and last played in Scotland in 2018.\nThe Norwegian side are halfway through their league season, but made these qualifiers by finishing third in the Eliteserien.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjlwy9pye9go"}
