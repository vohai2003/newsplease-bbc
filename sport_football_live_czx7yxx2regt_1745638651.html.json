The question of consistency is key. If we could have maintained that level we would have scored two or three more goals because we were really dominant.\n\"We allowed our opponent to find solutions and confidence and they scored and it was deserved at that part of the game.\n\"In the last stage of the game we were better. It was more a reaction than massive control. We found a solution and that is a positive for us.\"\nCardiff City boss Omer Riza told BBC Radio Wales:\n\"When you come to a place like this if you leave with a point, the way the league is at the moment, you are happy and we should have come away with a point.\n\"One lapse of concentration from a freekick. We don't get given cheap opportunities like that.\n\"Yousef Salech had one saved which could have made it 2-1. If we had left here with a point I think we would have deserved it.\n\"If that chance goes in it is 2-1 and they are chasing the game. But we've conceded a goal, the manner of which I'm unhappy with, having worked so hard.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/czx7yxx2regt"}
