To get into the next round would be absolutely brilliant.\n\"Hopefully we can go all the way, who knows? Do you want to bet against us? With the additions we've made in January, I'm optimistic.\n\"Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford are just on a different level. Considering where we were a few years ago when Unai Emery came in, we've just excelled.\n\"No-one would have thought we'd be here in the Champions League, and now we've also made the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. It's been a brilliant season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cdjyxdk2xp8o"}
