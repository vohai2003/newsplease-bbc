I know he is a good-quality player and in possession he is really good, and he was very calm and collected.\n\"But I thought, defensively, he picked up good positions, dealt with one-on-one situations, read the game well. It was a brilliant debut.\"\nLawlor has had to bide his time at club level but has been part of Chris Gunter's Under-19 team that has reached the Elite group of their European Championship qualifiers alongside Manchester United hot prospect Gabrielle Biancheri.\nHe was also part of the Wales Under-17 side that reached the Euro finals two years ago, scoring the goal to seal qualification.\nLawlor described his debut as \"surreal\" but Riza hinted he could now experience more opportunities having had recent availability problems at the back.\n\"We have had Jesper's [Daland] injury, Will [Fish] hasn't played loads of minutes and he's again played two 90s in a row, Goutas was suspended; we have had a few issues in that position, so it's a good option to have,\" he said.\n\"Joel Bagan can do it and Perry can fill in but it's just nice for him [Lawlor].\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/czx7yr0dx71o"}
