For Manchester United, it was a brilliant point but better than that is the performance.\nTo stand toe-to-toe with a Liverpool side, who are playing well, and slug it out - the Manchester United fans are delighted, not with the result but they loved that performance.\nThey have been waiting for that for a long time. They want this manager to do well.\nHere's the hard bit: do it every week now. That's what you have got to do in the Premier League, if you are going to be in any way challenging for the European places.\nI'm really impressed with United. The supporters got what they deserved and they have been royally entertained.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg3ex69e7ko"}
