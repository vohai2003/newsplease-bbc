I think we were the team with more chances. I don't think it's a good point because we were closer than them to winning it.\n\"Evanilson is helping us all season. He broke his foot and had to rest a little bit, but he is finishing very strong at the end of the season. We are scoring lots of goals but the reason why we aren't winning is from the other side.\n\"We really should not concede two goals in this game. It's not a game where you should be conceding two goals. We conceded from two crosses. From very little, we concede two goals and it cost us a lot.\n\"We are not being effective. When you have the better chances, you are not feeling happy with a point. They had very little chances, but it's true that on the set plays we did not mark [Niclas] Fullkrug. The second goal is more merit for them, it is a great header.\n\"But it's very little to concede two goals and it's costing us a lot more. I'm not happy with a point.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn5x7zzpr3do"}
