Another Aussie in Calem Nieuwenhof has joined the three already in place. Further signings from Japan and Costa Rica are also expected in the coming days.\nProgression to the group stages of the Europa Conference League this season will be difficult with potential ties against the likes of Aston Villa or Eintracht Frankfurt waiting should they get past either Rosenborg or Crusaders.\nHowever, itâ€™s Hearts' final league position that will ultimately decide if this has been a successful campaign. They get under way this weekend with a trip to under-fire St Johnstone.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2l983907v9o"}
