She has not been to school since October last year.\nPreviously she attended the \"support hub\" at her Aberdeenshire primary but became increasingly isolated from her peers, eventually refusing to go anywhere near the school.\nNatalie was reassured that mainstream education was the right place for her daughter but she now regrets that.\n\"The impact on children who need that extra support, in a place that doesn't have the budget or the resources to give them that support affects detrimentally the self- esteem and wellbeing both of the children that need it - but also the other children in the classroom as well,\" she told BBC Scotland News.\nShe accepts there are funding pressures, but believes cuts being made in areas like psychological support are impacting some of the most vulnerable children.\n\"It's all well and good saying you can make this cut now - but you've got to look at the longer term.\"\nTeaching union NASUWT said the report showed the presumption of mainstream education had been introduced as a policy without sufficient planning or resources, and was now \"plainly not fit for purpose\".\nGeneral secretary Dr Patrick Roach said schools were left struggling to do their best, but with too many children not getting the support they needed.\n\"Many teachers are increasingly expected to teach children with such high and complex needs that they require almost one-on-one support, at the same time as teaching the rest of their class,\" he said.\n\"Such a situation undermines the right of all pupils to a high-quality education and those pupils who deserve to have their additional learning needs met with specialist support.\"\nScottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said the report was a \"damning verdict\" showing children were being let down.\n\"Just as the attainment gap between the most and least deprived has widened under John Swinney's government, this report identifies a gulf in outcomes between students who receive support and the rest,\" he said.\nScottish Labour said there was a \"shameful\" failure to grasp the scale of the problem.\nThe party's education spokeswoman Pam Duncan-Glancy said: \"Parents are constantly fighting for their children's education and teachers are being worked to the bone but they aren't getting the support they need from the government.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0q1wyeevvgo"}
