I'd like as many people as possible to see the collection I've got. After all, coal mining made Great Britain famous.\"\nHe added: \"When we left school at 15 on the Friday, we had to start work in the mine on the Monday.\n\"It's about the wonderful stories of how we worked and how we played.\"\nHis collection takes over a room in his house that extends from books on the floor to plates filling shelves to the ceiling.\nIt includes several helmets, more than 40 lamps, first-aid kits, tin lunch boxes and pictures dating back to the start of his mining career in the 1950s.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjydkedgpmo"}
