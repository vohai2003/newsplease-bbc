I miss her, our love and companionship in the 60 years since I met her at ballroom and old-time dancing lessons.\n\"We continued dancing until she died â€“ going to tea dances twice a week.\n\"We all miss her greatly for her love and helpfulness. She worked at the RVS shop at Northampton General Hospital for 17 years and did voluntary work at three charity shops at various times.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15qwwwpv88o"}
