We think it is 15, soon to be 16, but Johnson is favourite to go one better in his rival's absence next season.\nSnooker player, 52-The greatest world champion there's never been? Six finals. Six defeats. Including four by Stephen Hendry. \"I used to like the nightclubs and the gambling and Stephen used to like picking up the trophies,\" said White.\nGolfer, 35 - Another whirlwind, El Nino is a gifted player, but without a major. Second twice in both the USPGA and the Open Championship, where he blew a three-shot lead going into the final round in 2007. Scot Colin Montgomerie went one better, with five seconds in majors, although he was an even bigger talisman than the Spaniard for Europe in the Ryder Cup.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/31297413"}
