In the last few games we have been on the wrong side of things.\n\"Pay refs what they're worth to get more people excited about doing it and recruited.\n\"I thought we could have been further ahead. I thought we were the best team throughout, but certainly in the first half.\"\nSt Helens head coach Paul Wellens:\n\"I thought we were absolutely outstanding in the second half.\n\"It was pleasing as a coach that we were able to turn that one around. We put ourselves under pressure from the get-go and Salford are a side with attacking threat who challenge you.\n\"At half-time we said 'we have got to create a game where we are comfortable'. We started to take opportunities and at the back end of the game, we finished a few things off.\n\"We were asking questions and building pressure. When we got that first score we gave ourselves a chance. What we had success with in the second half was being patient and they started to fatigue. It's a blueprint for us.\"\nSalford: Brierley, Sio, Cross, Lafai, Burgess, Croft, Sneyd, Singleton, Ackers, Partington, Watkins, Stone, Addy.\nInterchanges: Ormondroyd, Vuniyayawa, Atkin, Hellewell.\nSt Helens: Welsby, Makinson, Percival, Davies, Ritson, Lomax, Dodd, Lees, Roby, Delaney, Royle, Bell, Knowles.\nInterchanges: Sironen, Norman, Baxter, Mbye.\nReferee: Jack Smith.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/66397941"}
