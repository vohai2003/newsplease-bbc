It wasn't a classic by any stretch. The game lacked quality in the final third.\n\"We changed the shape after about an hour, got an extra striker on and finished the game really strongly. I felt going into the last half-hour that one goal would be enough and I'm delighted we were able to get it.\n\"We put a big emphasis on set-plays. We've got some really good delivery coming into the box and then it's about movement and being aggressive.\n\"We set a target for ourselves of 45 points at the start of the season - we believed that was what the magic number was going to be to get top six. Publicly we talked about staying in the league but inside we had our own ambitions.\n\"We're not quite there yet. We've given ourselves a great chance with this result and the expectations have changed as the season has gone on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn4j9gllp7po"}
