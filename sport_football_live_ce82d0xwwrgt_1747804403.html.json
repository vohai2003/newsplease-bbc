It's frustrating because that becomes the narrative. With the chances we had and the situations we got into, you have to put the ball in the net.\n\"We've been here before but I'll see what he's like in training and see how he reacts. It's very naive to think 'the goalie makes a mistake, so change the goalie'.\n\"If the goalie you put in makes a mistake in the next game, where do you go then? Change him again? I don't think so. I will rely on my experience to make the right decisions.\n\"But the responsibility of the team is to score some goals in a game we were on top of for most of it.\"\nSunderland head coach Regis Le Bris told BBC Radio Newcastle:\n\"We were really well connected and won many duels and our team spirit was impressive again.\n\"They put many bodies in the box and they tried different options to create situations but we defended well.\n\"Until the end we were on the edge but the mentality of the team is getting better â€“ you can feel it now.\n\"Probably three or four months ago we would have lost that game and we've lost many points in these circumstances, so this was positive.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ce82d0xwwrgt"}
