Here are some of your comments:\nJoseph: Keep Garnacho and let Ruben Amorim improve his football. He has the potential to be a fantastic talent. Let's not waste it. We got rid of Anthony Elanga and look at hime now. You could say the board has no brains at all!\nJon: Unfortunately, the numbers, facts and data do not lie. I have spent the season watching him and things are just not improving at all. His performances are getting worse!\nGreg: This is exactly why other young players flourish away from Old Trafford. There isn't another club in this country where the expectation on a 20-year-old is so ridiculously high. Compare him with Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah at the same age.\nRichard: Get rid of him. He is too inconsistent.\nEric: Garnacho is an excellent talent - young and exciting. Needs to step up, yes, but if the players around him improve, so will he. Confidence is lacking and he tries too hard. But his decision making is starting to improve, and it will even more with more experience.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20xgx033zlo"}
