The midfielder took the resulting penalty himself but it was palmed away by keeper Toby Savin before Tyrese Shade put the rebound wide.\nEastleigh's bad luck continued as both Noa Boutin and Nathan Tshikuna struck the crossbar, while Ben Close had a goal disallowed after 57 minutes for a foul during the build-up.\nThings finally seemed to turn in the Spitfires' favour on the hour mark when they were awarded another spot-kick, this time for a challenge on Luis Fernandez, with Chris Maguire slotting into the bottom corner.\nHowever, that brought Halifax to life and they snatched an unlikely equaliser a minute before time when Galvin successfully met Jack Jenkins' corner with his head.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/czjn94zwyg4t"}
