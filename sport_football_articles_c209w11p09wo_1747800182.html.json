At the same time, we tried to achieve the result playing in the way we want to play.\n\"At some moments, the team was very good. Then, we don't work every day - we don't like to finish the game like we did in the last five minutes. If we want to become an important team, we need to win in a dirty way, ugly way and [I'm] quite happy.\n\"Overall, I think it was a very good performance. I think we deserved to win the game. We created enough chances already in the first half to score. In the last 10 minutes, I think the team showed effort, togetherness, spirit and it's something that we need.\n\"If you measure on the result, then for sure if we achieve Champions League it is an important thing but from my point of view, I try to see how we improve day by day. I can see, since the first day, the team is getting better and better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c209w11p09wo"}
