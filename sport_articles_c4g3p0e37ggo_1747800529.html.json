It was a brilliant display and one that psychologically could be huge for the league run-in.\nAlthough, it must be a tad frustrating for manager Simo Valakari that performances like this have been so rare this term. Still, he will be focusing on the positives and hoping the result will spark something.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g3p0e37ggo"}
