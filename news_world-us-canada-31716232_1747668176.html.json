In this arm wrestle, the president seems to have come out on top,\" the BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel said.\nThe issue has created a rift in the Republican Party and has threatened Mr Boehner's position as the leader of the House.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31716232"}
