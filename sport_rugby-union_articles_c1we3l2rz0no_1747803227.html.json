Williams converted and added a penalty.\nOspreys are playing with an attacking freedom under Jones and that was typified by an outstanding move with Tipuric rolling back the years by providing the final pass to Kasende.\nHosts prop Tom Botha was not penalised for a ruck clearance on Benetton hooker Agustin Creevy and the hosts continued their first-half onslaught when centre Keiran Williams crashed over.\nOspreys hooker Lewis Lloyd denied Benetton flanker Izekor a late first-half try with a brilliant covering tackle, but injured himself and was replaced by Ethan Lewis.\nThere was no score in the third quarter in the Swansea rain before Ospreys secured the bonus-point try when Walsh cantered over for a personal double for a second successive home game.\nNumber eight Morse, who only turned 20 earlier this month, showed his promise with a powerful burst off the back of a scrum for the fifth try.\nScrum-half Hardy completed the scoring as Ospreys did not concede a point in a home league match in Swansea for the first time in almost four years.\nOspreys head coach Mark Jones: \"The boys were great. It was a pleasure to watch them out there.\n\"We were not expecting the scoreboard to get up as quickly as it did but it wasn't easy and we had to work for it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c1we3l2rz0no"}
