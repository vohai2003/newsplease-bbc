Rocky Bushiri and Jordan Smith continue to prove the doubters wrong. We need to be more clinical but in the end, we're in the quarters, job done and let's hope for a home tie.\nJohn: Relieved to get into the next round. Yet again back three were excellent with Rocky deservedly getting player of the match, both Caddens [Nicky and Chris] played well but up front we were poor.\nAnon: Smith was man of the match for Hibs. Ayr were very good, glad Hibs played up till the end and got through a tricky away leg.\nMartin: Was always going to be a hard game but the character and grit showed immensely. The team are playing for one another and it's a really good time to be a hibee! Get offering Cadden, Martin Boyle and Rocky new deals. They deserve it!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx2px8wg03wo"}
