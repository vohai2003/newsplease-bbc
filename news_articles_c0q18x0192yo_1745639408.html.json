And the US has an embassy here and [there are] a number of US organisations we've accommodated here in Maseru.\"\nHe later told the AFP news agency: \"We are not taking this matter lightly,\" adding that they would send an official protest letter to Washington.\nOfficials dismissed Trump's remarks as \"off the cuff\" and a \"political statement\", adding that they were \"uncalled-for\" given the good relations between the two nations.\n\"We maintain very warm and cordial relations with the US. They've got a mission in Maseru and we also have [one] in Washington,\" foreign affairs spokesperson Kutloano Pheko told the BBC.\nMr Pheko was unable to confirm Trump's comments on the funding that went to LGBTQ organisations, saying that as the money went directly to them, they would be best placed to comment.\nMpotjoane, on his part, confirmed that the country had been affected by Trump's sudden decision to pause aid funding to countries around the world.\nMany organisations, mostly non-governmental, were thrown into chaos after the Trump administration announced a permanent end to the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) funding as part of a wider cost-cutting drive to reduce US government spending.\nPepfar was launched in 2003 by then US President George W Bush and its finances are distributed via the US government's main overseas aid agency USAID, whose funding has also been cut.\nLesotho is among those countries that benefited from Pepfar, its health ministry told South African publication GroundUp in February, with TB and HIV programmes among those receiving the critical funds.\nBut Mpotjoane declined to criticise this decision, saying it was the US's \"prerogative to cut aid if they want to\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0q18x0192yo"}
