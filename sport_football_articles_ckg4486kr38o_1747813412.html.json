It's nerve-wracking, that's for sure.\n\"It's the home of football. It will be a very, very big crowd. It's something to look forward to and embrace.\n\"You very, very rarely get to play in the best stadium in world football â€“ Wembley is the most iconic stadium out there. It's a big, big privilege to play there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg4486kr38o"}
