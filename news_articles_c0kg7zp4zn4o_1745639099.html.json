I wasn't doing anything special but obviously it seems I touched the heart of this particular operator.\"\nHe said he contacted the firm after he was sent two bills, which he thought said he owed about Â£500, but it was discovered that his account was actually in credit.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0kg7zp4zn4o"}
