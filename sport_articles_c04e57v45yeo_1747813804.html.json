The consistency throughout the group has been phenomenal all season.\n\"It was good to grind the result out. It was a wee bit nervy at the end of the game but we put bodies on the line, the players that came off the bench, that just shows why we're league winners.\n\"We took it one game at a time and did our talking indoors. I think a lot of people had us written off by January but we knew what group we had. We kept working hard and you can see that in the performances.\n\"We had fire in the belly today, we fought for each other and we've had that all season being the underdogs.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c04e57v45yeo"}
