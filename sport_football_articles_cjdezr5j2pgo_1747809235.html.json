However, it is getting close.\nWalker was given time to explore his options by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.\nThat has zeroed in on AC Milan, who are moving for Walker in preference to Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford given they could only sign one non-EU player.\nIt is not clear when the deal will be confirmed but once Wednesday's matches are out of the way, it should not be long.\nIt is expected to be an initial loan to the end of the season, with an agreed fee that would allow the Serie A side to buy the 34-year-old in the summer.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjdezr5j2pgo"}
