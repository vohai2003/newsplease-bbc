The ex-Southport striker turned sharply to find space in the box and curl home amid a scramble from a corner.\nAmond continued to threaten for the hosts, but Kane Richards missed a gilt-edged chance to put the visitors 2-0 up after 55 minutes and then Ryan Bird headed just wide in the closing moments to leave Pools in no doubt that getting back up will not be easy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40761291"}
