Yet it feels like our squad has weathered the worst of this storm and, relatively speaking, we have not come out of it too badly.\nSomehow, despite the inconsistencies, injuries and illnesses, we are still competing for three cups â€“ and I feel optimistic about our chances.\nObviously, the ultimate goal is to be consistently good in all competitions but, realistically, how many Spurs fans would moan if we won a cup this season - even if it meant finishing mid-table in the league?\nWhile our league performance has been particularly disappointing and disjointed so far, we are only just over halfway through the season, with key players due to return from injury and hopefully some additional reinforcements on their way in this transfer window.\nA win at our noisy neighbours on Wednesday could be just the boost we need and could also act as a catalyst for a strong finish to the season.\nOur players must produce the best of themselves - and Angeball - to win the north London derby. If they dare, they will do.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdd94p2en4eo"}
