I think the performance was good. The first half was a very good performance, I think we were clearly on top in the first half. In that spell, we should have taken our chances. In the second half, more even. In all of the game, we defended very well.\"\nOn keeping a first clean sheet at home in the Premier League for 11 months: \"That is crazy. That is a positive, I guess.\"\nOn the performance: \"The performance overall was very good. We were playing against a top team with a good manager. They are well-coached, they have spent billions on players. I think the way we played and performed today, we had the better chances to win the game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn4jzgjdz7wo"}
