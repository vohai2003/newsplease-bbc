It's tough but we have to get on with it and do better next time,\" Thorup told BBC Radio Norfolk.\n\"We had control of the game but in the first half we weren't good enough. We were not dangerous enough and didn't have the collective movement we needed to open up a low defending team.\n\"We knew it was down to us to create the flow and we were too slow. It was much better in the second half where we were better connected and we scored the goal, but it was not enough.\n\"We did better in the second half but I still expect us to be better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9d52054vpno"}
