He had 12 shots at Dundee, that is the highest total for a player in the Premiership this season.\nAll 12 of them were in the opposition box. Nine of them were on target. And that does not include his finish that was ruled out for offside.\nThe striker decided to save the one that counted for the 93rd minute. The best and the worst of the Nigerian was well and truly on show. Of course, he has to be more ruthless. But his character is admirable.\nOverall, it goes without saying that Rangers, who looked vulnerable throughout, cannot continue going two goals behind. And it could have been worse, with Dundee's Scott Tiffoney putting a glorious chance wide and Oluwaseun Adewumi smashing a post.\nBut Ferguson has brought some resilience to this side, who have shown in recent games they are far better at responding to adversity.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy5n5635ww2o"}
