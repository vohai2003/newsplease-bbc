We knew coming in that we would need to work very, very hard to get anything from the game, but the girls carried out our game plan.\n\"We had chances to go and score ourselves, we were a bit unlucky at times defensively, but overall, I thought we played very, very well.\n\"That could be a big point towards the end of the season, we're going to play Partick Thistle again twice more, so we'll have belief going into those games.\"\nPartick Thistle assistant manager Ross Stormonth: \"A tough result, we didn't really create enough in the final third, at the end of the day that sums up the season.\n\"We created some chances, kind of half chances, but not enough to go and deserve to win the game to be honest. We need to go back to the drawing board about how we're going to create and how we're going to score goals and it's been the story of the season.\n\"At the end of the day, we've got to try and go unbeaten, we've got to go and try and win every game and try and get as many points on the board as we can and start looking forward again.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c1kjv2v0p7ko"}
