They drive communities up the wall. It's harassment.\"\nShe said the government was aiming to strengthen police powers, adding that officers currently have to provide repeat warnings before they seize any bikes.\n\"We think they should be able to seize these anti-social bikes straight away,\" she added.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8vjvygm1jo"}
