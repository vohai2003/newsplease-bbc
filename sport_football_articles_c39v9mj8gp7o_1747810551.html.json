We were really rusty after three weeks with no competitive game. We only had one training before this game with everyone coming back from the national team. The structure wasn't good and everyone struggled.\n\"Key number two was Eberechi (Eze's) goal. It's unbelievable - the individual quality. Then we have the confidence and in our structure waiting for the right moments.\"\nOn Eze: \"What I told him I already said to you - it was so important the first goal because we got the belief back, we were really struggling in the beginning.
