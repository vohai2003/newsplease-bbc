They're conceding goals left, right and centre. This is it.\n\"This is a glorious opportunity. You couldn't have hand-picked a better fixture for Celtic to get the job done and get into the play-offs.\n\"So the draw and the flow of the games has worked to Celtic's advantage for sure. But they've had to amass this points total to give themselves a shot at getting through against the weakest team.\n\"I'd be staggered if they don't do it. I know Celtic haven't been great of late, but I think they're going to win this game comfortably.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgkjdgev4njo"}
