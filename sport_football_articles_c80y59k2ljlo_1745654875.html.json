I've said it before the fans are so committed to the club, so loyal to the club, so dedicated and so loyal to the team to our staff, to me as manager. I can only be grateful for that.\n\"We also gave them something. We gave them two prizes, after six years of drought.\n\"I was appreciated and I always felt that when I walked the streets of Manchester.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c80y59k2ljlo"}
