We got done by a moment of real quality, a fantastic goal from Shayden Morris.\n\"We know the strength he possesses, pace. It was disappointing to concede a goal in that manner, but you recognise it's a very good goal.\n\"I didn't think there was too much in the game, lots of endeavour, lots of effort from both teams. Challenging conditions with the wind. It was very similar to the Dundee United game, I'm just frustrated we didn't create any real opportunities to hurt Aberdeen.\n\"We were in enough good areas but lacked that bit of quality.\"\n\"It's a concern because we're not scoring goals, but we're all in it together. We recognise we need to get better.\n\"We had the news that Noah Chilvers was going to be out, and he's been our talisman in creating something. Now it's up to someone else to step up and take that role on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czd34d18828o"}
