But it also proved we can't do it on a consistent basis. That is the step we have to make.\nOn replacing David de Gea with Andre Onana\n\"He's a great goalkeeper and has a different profile. That's why we wanted to sign him. With him, something will change in our game.\"\nOn whether this is 'his' squad now\n\"I wouldn't call it an Erik ten Hag squad. It's the demands of top football. We either have to find players or increase the levels from those who are already there.\n\"Tours are good for team building, for new players to get the knowledge about the values and standards, on and off the field. It's helpful that the players we have signed are already here, integrating in the team and getting the social connections. Football is a team sport and you need partnerships.\"\nRead more of Ten Hag's answers here", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4n33577k14o"}
