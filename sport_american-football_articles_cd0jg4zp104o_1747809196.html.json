It was a tough week for us, a bunch of moving parts. It's been a whirlwind, but to come out here and play like we did, in all phases, I'm really proud of this group.\"\nMinnesota's trip to divisional rivals Detroit last week was the first game in NFL history between two 14-win teams, and it wasn't just the NFC North title on the line.\nThe winner clinched the NFC's number one seed, plus a bye for the first round of the play-offs and home-field advantage in the Divisional Round.\nThe loser had to settle for the fifth seed, no week off and a road trip on Wildcard Weekend.\nThat proved too much for the Vikings to overcome so, despite finishing the regular season with a 14-3 record, they have fallen at the first play-off hurdle for the second time in three years.\nThe Rams got off to a flying start, with Stafford finding Kyren Williams for a touchdown on the opening drive before LA added a field goal.\nThe Vikings replied with a field goal and had a touchdown chalked off after returning what they thought was a fumble by Stafford.\nBut just as it looked like they were getting a foothold in the game, Darnold turned the ball over on successive drives.\nHe was intercepted by Cobie Durant before Ahkello Witherspoon sacked the Vikings quarterback to force a fumble, with Jared Verse scooping up the loose ball to run in a 57-yard touchdown.\nStafford hit a wide-open Davis Allen for his second touchdown pass right before the half and, although Darnold found TJ Hockenson for a 26-yard score in the third quarter, the Vikings then accepted their fate after a season that promised so much.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cd0jg4zp104o"}
