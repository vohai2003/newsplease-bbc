He was combining well with Liam Cooper and [doing] the defensive stuff, short balls out and relieving the pressure, but there were also some great long balls and starting attacks.\n\"He's sort of the Kalvin [Phillips] replacement that [Marc] Roca was meant to be.\n\"It's a very high bar, it's only one match and only a friendly, but if that was an example of his level then I think he's a good signing.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cqq4e49zk6yo"}
