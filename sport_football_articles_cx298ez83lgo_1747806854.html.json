Only one side has won six successive away games in which they began the day outside of the top 10 in the competition - Arsenal from December 2020 to May 2021.\nExcluding own goals, Brentford have scored from their first shot of a match nine times in the Premier League this season - the most of any side. Meanwhile, Newcastle have conceded the first shot they have faced nine times - also a league-high figure.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx298ez83lgo"}
