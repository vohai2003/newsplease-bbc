And their now former head coach.\nGoing back to Spain to manage Valencia may prove to be a risk for 41-year-old Corberan.\nJust ask one of his predecessors in the job, Gary Neville!\nThe men from the Mestalla are in the relegation zone, have had financial difficulties and, since current Aston Villa boss Unai Emery left in 2012, only one manager has lasted longer than two years in charge.\nBut then there's Albion's own financial situation.\nCorberan's hands have been tied for most of his 26-month reign.\nHe was appointed as Steve Bruce's successor in October 2022 when chairman Guochuan Lai was still officially at the helm, but in name only, with presence and financial support completely non-existent. Yet Corberan organised a team who went from the relegation zone to just missing out on a 2022-23 Championship play-off place.\nThe following season, he did achieve a place in the top six, losing in the semis to Southampton, with whom he was also linked last week - again without a single penny for his recruitment team to spend.\nBut his coaching qualities came to the fore as he turned cast-offs such as Cedric Kipre, Alex Mowatt into vital members of his starting XI, which he has done again this season with Karlan Grant.\nDespite American businessman Shilen Patel's February takeover, the club's financial restrictions remain ongoing. Only last week it was revealed that the decreased wage budget back in the summer was actually as much as 30%, forcing the loss of several players.\nFor the Baggies, it's a blow in the short term â€“ particularly the timing of it with three games to come in six days over the festive period. But it may be a move that suits all parties.\nCorberan gets to finally test himself in the top flight of an elite league, he gets a move close to his family and that vocal minority of Albion fans who've become tired of his football will get to see something different.\nHowever, that comes with a side warning of 'be careful what you wish for' because the job he has done in stabilising the club on the field during a period of utter turmoil cannot be understated and they're definitely in a better place compared with two years ago.\nHe should leave with the well wishes of the majority of Baggies supporters - and definitely will with those he worked with at the training ground because, as well as being a top coach, most importantly, he is a decent man.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cge9z3x35rqo"}
