Our mission and our goal in these months is to make this gap shorter. Not in terms of points, but feeling we can really compete with them in every game.\n\"Some results against these teams were good, others not. Why not understand that we can compete against them?\"\nHere are more key lines from Arroyo's news conference before Sunday's game (14:30 GMT)", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2jpr45vdyo"}
