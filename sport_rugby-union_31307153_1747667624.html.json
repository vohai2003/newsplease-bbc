Stuart Hogg and Mark Bennett and Finn Russell carrying the ball in the midfield and Alex Dunbar, there was a lot of good, attacking rugby from Scotland.\"\nWales will travel to Murrayfield on Sunday smarting from their own defeat at home to England.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/31307153"}
