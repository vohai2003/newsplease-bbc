It's fairly hectic on a normal week.\"\nBut he added he was hopeful things would improve quickly.\n\"Once we get through the logistics of how our businesses can sustain a normal day I think it'll just become the new norm,\" he said.\n\"And once everyone gets used to it, businesses will carry on surviving.\"\nTandridge District Council's leader, Catherine Sayer, said she believed Surrey County Council understood from the meeting how important it was to improve access and signage for businesses that were affected.\nThe district council, which is also housing some families in emergency accommodation, said with a timescale in place, long-term plans can now be made.\n\"I know some of the residents have sourced Airbnbs that would match the price the council has to pay for Travelodge accommodation,\" she said.\n\"It costs us Â£500 a week to house a family in a Travelodge.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99ny2eglpko"}
