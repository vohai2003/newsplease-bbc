Plus, they remain in the FA Cup and they have the chance to retain it.\nThose cups could make a difference to their season, so if they do start to improve and show better performances then they have the opportunity to be in two cup finals and finish a very disappointing season positively.\nPlus, it will help the fans to gain connection and belief in Amorim and the new players.\nManchester United might not be back next season competing for the Premier League title, but if they can show they are taking small steps forward then that is all they can ask for.\nIn this moment, it feels like it has been stationary, perhaps even moving backwards or sideways.\nWhich leads me to my fear of fans losing faith in Amorim before the season finishes. He has said since he arrived that it would be a long process, but naturally people still want results in this moment as well.\nIf the team is showing no signs of progression at all, then the worst case scenario is that fans want someone else on the side line. And given recent performances, that worst case scenario does not feel a million miles away.\nIt should be because he is a young, intelligent manager, who understands the challenge ahead and what it means to coach at a club like Manchester United.\nBut he has not been able to shine, so to say people have been disappointed in what they have seen so far would probably be an understatement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cj677r3p81ko"}
