I think it is a little bit mixed.\n\"One moment we are thinking it is maybe not too bad. But that's why we are doubling up.\n\"We are just waiting for the swelling to go down before he goes for the scan and we'll get a better idea in the next few days.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1jgr23y688o"}
