They're a very good team. It requires a lot of effort. We were solid and compact. Very positive game.\n\"After this period we had conceding it was important to go back to basics - solid, clean sheet. We had a couple of moments to do it better. But in terms of the game, positive because it was very important to go back to the team we are that allows us to be successful.\n\"They have danger all over the place. Set-pieces are some of them. It requires focus. The boys did well. We prepared it.\n\"This is one of the main messages, more than anything, the feeling of being a team that don't concede too many chances, always in the right places, organised, balanced. Going forward we have talent.\n\"Our fans have been amazing for us. Today again. No legs but they give us the extra run to the players. Can't thank them enough. We have to enjoy the journey and realise it's not always possible to go with a victory. They saw a good team a team who competed very well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvg55355eq0o"}
