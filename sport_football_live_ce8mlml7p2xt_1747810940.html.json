Stead twice went close to adding his second of the match and Ryan Glover's effort from outside the box was deflected for a corner.\nGateshead ensured a nervy ending when Jovan Malcom reduced the deficit with seven minutes remaining, but the Bees had the last word as Stead's solo effort in the closing moments made it 3-1.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ce8mlml7p2xt"}
