Thirty goals this season is a sensational return and he must be a stick on for every player of the year award going.\nIt is no wonder Celtic want to extend his deal, which ends in two years.\nA lot of focus had been on Viljami Sinisalo in goal with this being just his second Celtic start.\nIn that early period when Hearts looked threatening, he looked confident and very comfortable with the ball at his feet. His early save helped Celtic take control.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crmjm98139go"}
