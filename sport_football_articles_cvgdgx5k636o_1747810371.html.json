It's a point and we take it - they are a good team.\n\"The next step is to reward ourselves with goals. We created so many good things due to good structure.\n\"We had a lot of opportunities but we needed to be a bit calmer and show more efficiency. We need to be more clinical with the positions we created.\n\"If we had given Watford the same chances that we had, I think they would have taken them.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgdgx5k636o"}
