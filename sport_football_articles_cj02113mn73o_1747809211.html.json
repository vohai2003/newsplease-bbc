We all are,\" Sorensen said.\nSpeaking ahead of Everton's WSL game against Leicester on Sunday (14:00 GMT kick-off), Sorensen said losing a third player to an ACL injury this season was \"not ideal\".\n\"In the three years I've been here we hadn't had any [ACL injures] until this season, and that was number three so it's not ideal,\" he said.\n\"From a playing point of view, we will manage. It's definitely not ideal to lose your captain but we'll manage. It's probably more around mentality and what she means to the squad.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj02113mn73o"}
