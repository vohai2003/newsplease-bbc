The St Johnstone defence were shellshocked and shredded before half past three.\nThey've now conceded 19 first-half goals in 22 league games this season. It won't shock anyone, but that's a league high.\nWith Kyle Cameron and Lewis Neilson returning to their parent clubs, Simo Valakari is in dire need of defensive recruits. In truth, they're need of bodies all over the shop.\nTheir attack has attracted plaudits, and while the desire to charge forward is commendable, it's coming at a cost. No one sits back and protects the defence.\nThe gung-ho approach also loses praise when shots are finishing up in the stands.\nIt was much better in the second half, but it couldn't have been much worse.\nIt's only the beginning of January, but the relegation word is very much in the conversation already.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvg6d19er6ro"}
