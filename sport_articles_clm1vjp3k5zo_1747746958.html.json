I have spoken to the players, and we know that is now gone. We have got enough quality in there to go and win games; we will be fine this season.\"\nWhen asked about pressure building following the disapointing start to the season, MacLean said: \"I think you have got use that as motivation as well. People always want to write you off. I think that is our culture in Scotland and Britain. Everybody wants to write people off, they try and build you up to try and shoot you down.\n\"I am thick skinned, I can handle criticism and I want my players to react properly to that.\n\"I quite enjoy people trying to write me off, and the players should enjoy it as well. Embrace it - go and prove people wrong.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/clm1vjp3k5zo"}
