Closing down, one-touch passing, not many long balls. Second half, we fell out of it, but great to get a winner.\nAlan: A bad team do not accumulate 31 points in this league without some merit. We really lack a striker who can score regularly but are indebted to defenders and midfielders to plug that gap. Give the new manager some slack and allow him to continue with the high-pressing, attacking style which produced last night's result.\nD: Great performance full of energy and intensity under Wimmer. A great style of play that was pleasing to see, much different to the rubbish hoof-ball we saw under Stuart Kettlewell. That's a game we'd have lost under the previous management, very excited by the future under Wimmer.\nNorrie: Just looked at the stats - 14 shots, six on target. Probably not far off the last eight games in total! Onwards and upwards. No point in belittling the former management, the stats in one game say enough. Let the team now prove they are good enough to stay in the Premiership.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c5y4ed4y9xqo"}
