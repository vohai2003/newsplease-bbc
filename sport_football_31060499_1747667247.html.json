It might be we have to use him from time to time at centre-half, but that's not what we've brought him in for.\n\"We needed someone that knows the league and has played lots of matches in the league.\"\nAnd Hasselbaink said Naylor, whose contract with Derby expires in the summer, has the chance to earn a long-term deal.\n\"It is a big chance for him,\" added Hasselbaink. \"We might be able to offer him a contract for next year if he does well during his loan.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31060499"}
