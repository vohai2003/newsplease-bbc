I got out there on the field and I looked up from the line of scrimmage and was like 'OK they're blitzing' and I could deal with it right away.\n\"It was like I had the answers to the test.\n\"That's where I was great, that's what my magic super power was. It wasn't how fast I could run it was how fast I could diagnose what they were doing.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cwywk4q75qwo"}
