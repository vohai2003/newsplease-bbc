A product of the Manchester City youth set-up, McAtee scored in last month's win over Bayern Munich during an impressive pre-season.\nHe played an influential role and scored nine goals in 37 loan appearances, including 21 starts, as Sheffield United secured automatic promotion back to the Premier League in 2022-23.\nCity are not short of world-class midfielders such as Kevin De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden, but McAtee will be eager to emulate fellow academy graduate Rico Lewis, who stepped up to the first team with aplomb last season after being promoted by Pep Guardiola.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c88vyw2e9zyo"}
