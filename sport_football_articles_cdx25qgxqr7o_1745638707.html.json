I expected the game they prepared for us, but we controlled the game.\n\"The early goal in the second half helped. When you score the first goal it is massive. It gave us more space but we had to carry on playing with intensity.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cdx25qgxqr7o"}
