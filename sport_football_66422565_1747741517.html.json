Three USA players missed, including their footballing icon Megan Rapinoe on her last appearance on the world stage, before Sweden won in remarkable circumstances.\nUSA keeper Alyssa Naeher appeared to have saved Lina Hurtig's effort at the second attempt, having pushed the initial effort up before clawing it out.\nBut after checking with the video assistant referee (VAR), referee Stephanie Frappart awarded the goal as Sweden won 5-4 on penalties to spark wild celebrations.\nSweden go through to face Japan in the quarter-finals.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66422565"}
