They were fortunate James' stamp did not prove too costly and they showed the type of resilience that has formed since Wiegman's arrival in September 2021.\nJames will miss the quarter-finals and could face a longer suspension should Fifa deem it worthy.\nHer loss will certainly be felt given she is England's leading scorer at the tournament, having also popped up to provide the winner in the 1-0 victory over Denmark in the second group game.\n\"I don't know what my heart rate is, I just know I'm 10 years' older,\" said manager Wiegman.\n\"I was not worried. It was a really intense game. Nigeria has done really well in the group stages so we were not underestimating them at all and they showed what a good team they were.\n\"We had trouble getting out of their press. We could do a little better but I also think we should give them credit.\"\nNigeria manager Randy Waldrum had already praised his side's efforts in escaping a group containing Olympic champions Canada, co-hosts Australia and plucky debutants the Republic of Ireland.\nHe said victory over European champions England could have had \"significant implications\" for the development of women's football in Nigeria, but they can exit the tournament with their heads held high.\nThey more than matched England and carried momentum going into extra time, but just could not provide the ruthlessness that was needed.\n\"[The players] have been fantastic all tournament,\" said Waldrum. \"We've played four matches, including against the Olympic gold medallists and the European champions and had clean sheets in those games.\n\"I'm so proud of them. They have such a bright future. The players came together in an unbelievable way. They just played their hearts out and I couldn't be more proud of them.\n\"We can be and should be one of the top teams in the world. I think we have shown we're capable of playing with anybody.\"\nEngland captain Millie Bright made numerous last-ditch blocks, Earps faced more shots in the first half than in any other game under Wiegman and Nigeria rattled the Lionesses.\nAll signs had started to point to a historic Nigeria victory - they were seeking to become the first African nation to win a knockout tie - and even a corner from Stanway floated out of play in a rare break-up of Nigeria possession late in the second half.\nBut in the end England found a way, as they so often have under Wiegman, and it was the familiar sight of Kelly - who netted the winning penalty in the shootout victory over Brazil in the Women's Finalissima and scored the Euro 2022 winner against Germany - who ran away celebrating at the end.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66420237"}
