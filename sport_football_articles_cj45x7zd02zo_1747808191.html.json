Instead, Palace went there and absolutely dismantled Fulham.\n\"Marco Silva's side didn't look like they had any ideas or answers and Palace looked a class above.\n\"When you look at Palace now and look into the future of what could happen to them, you think about the players that could be poached. Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Ismaila Sarr, Adam Wharton and Jean-Phillipe Mateta would be the ones I expect teams to come in for because of the season they are having.\n\"I am looking at the teams left in the FA Cup and they are probably the one team that could just focus on the competition, so that is an advantage when any one of those teams could win it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj45x7zd02zo"}
