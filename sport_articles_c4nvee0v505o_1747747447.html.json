Doku is certainly one of those players.\n\"As for Olise, he looks absolutely phenomenal from what I saw of Palace last season and lights up the pitch every time he plays.\n\"He is young enough to mould, but has that natural gift and talent Guardiola would want to shape.\n\"Ultimately, I think it will be difficult for him to stay at Palace - but if he does, he will be loved.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4nvee0v505o"}
