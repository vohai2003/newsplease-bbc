We came back, we could have won the game - we hit the post twice in the second half. So we were unlucky.\n\"A lot of people are expecting us to go down. I get that - the last couple of times we've been up, we've gone straight back down, so the reputation's there.\n\"But I think we've got a strong team and I don't see why we can aim as high as we can. Top six should be the aim for being optimistic, so we'll see what happens.\n\"There's always a benefit from being the underdog and that's where we are this season. Nobody expects much from us and hopefully we can prove them wrong.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c51vz5388n4o"}
