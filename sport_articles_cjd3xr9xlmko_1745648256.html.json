I felt for all the players out there.\n\"We had to just play for territory and make sure we didn't make mistakes. We spoke about the game, about the pitch and conditions where mistakes could win it. One of the only times they were in our box in the first half, we've not dealt with the situation.\n\"We've got to do it the hard way, try and come from behind. The effort of the players was magnificent. We kept going, tried to make necessary changes, tried to add a bit of freshness. The second half we were good. We were the dominant team. You don't see a lot of teams doing that up here. We gave it a go, unfortunate not to get anything from the game.\n\"It's been a tough week. We were close to Aberdeen, close today, close against Rangers. But it's the stage of the season where you'd rather win a game and not deserve to win.\n\"It's a major disappointment but I've been in dressing rooms a long time, I can see the commitment and motivation of the players to do better. We'll get better as we go along, we'll get one or two back.\"\n\"I see signs that we'll be alright.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cjd3xr9xlmko"}
