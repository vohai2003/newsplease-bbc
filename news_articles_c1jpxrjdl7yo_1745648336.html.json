Even the officer referred to himself as 'Mr Angry' and the text messages reflect this,\" the panel said.\nIt also found he waited outside her home to see if and when she returned and subjected her to \"belittling and insulting name calling\".\nThe panel said there is \"increasing awareness\" of \"coercive, controlling and overbearing behaviour\" in society.\n\"There is no doubt that reputational harm will be caused to TVP by an officer conducting himself in this way,\" it found.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jpxrjdl7yo"}
