But football is football.\n\"We started well, but they score and we have to do better in how we defend. It is difficult to be 2-0 down at home at half-time in a really important game.\n\"But, the belief and the character of the players - and supporters who pushed us until the last second - I'm so proud of that. That atmosphere will be the difference at the end of the season.\n\"It was important that we didn't lose today and we tried to win. We have to fix some parts and do better but the way we attacked them in the second half was really strong.\n\"We started quite well but then they score and some stresses come in. The second half we had more players in the box, we were more direct. The players who came on brought a lot of quality.\n\"I like to see players who, during the season, get better and better. They grow on the training pitch and in the gym. They grow more important on the pitch. Kevin will be an important asset for us now he's showing good form.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/clyznzp21weo"}
