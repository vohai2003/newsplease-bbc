Our away form has been good but I didn't see enough of that tonight.\n\"We've lost games before this season and we don't get ahead of ourselves and think we're the finished article. It's always about trying to strive for consistency and that's always the challenge. Tonight shows we're not there yet and we have to keep working on it.\n\"St Johnstone winning tonight gives them momentum, it closes the gap but we're not going to get caught up on one result, one performance.\n\"We're really disappointed and frustrated right now but we've only got a couple of days before another really important game so we need to get back to what we've done in previous games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cy4l8x5y7zno"}
