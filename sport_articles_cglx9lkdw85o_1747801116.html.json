They are good at that, but we were really stable as a team today. Everybody took responsibility. We kept them out for most of the game.\n\"It was difficult for us to create chances today but I've looked at Shayden's goal and it's amazing. We're happy, they are three important points for us.\n\"If you look at his journey this year, the assists and goals he gets, how he defends... it's good to see players take steps and grow. It's a lot of work from his side, he has a strong mentality, he pushes himself.\"\n\"It was a different kind of game [to last week], not so open. It was more about second balls. But the structure of the team was good. Everybody fought and that's important.\n\"We don't think about [other games]. We have to keep winning our games, and not think about other teams.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cglx9lkdw85o"}
