It's just that selection fear, Ange Postecoglou won't play Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, but are they going to be undercooked?\n\"I understand what both managers are thinking, but it really adds to the occasion.\n\"I can't remember a game which is so highly-pressurised for both sets of teams.\"\nOn Postecoglou, Sutton added: \"Tottenham play Brighton in that last game. Just imagine the atmosphere at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium if Tottenham lose (the final). Postecoglou walking out, I suspect he might not be in charge if he loses the final as that will be as toxic as anything.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3088pl4p0mo"}
