Great experience.\"\nElsewhere, American Kenny Bednarerk ran a time of 10.07secs to beat Jamaica's Oblique Seville in the men's 100m with Briton Zharnel Hughes coming third.\nNewly crowned world indoor 400m champion Chris Bailey maintained his impressive start to the year by edging Britain's Matt Hudson-Smith.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/cvg7r84zv1no"}
