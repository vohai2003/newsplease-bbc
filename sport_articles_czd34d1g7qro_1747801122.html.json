Securing their top-six status last weekend was one objective, albeit the very minimum objective , ticked off.\nNow, it's all about chasing down a European place, and trying to secure third spot. On the evidence of what happened in Dingwall, manager Jimmy Thelin's side appear to be very well placed to mount a concerted challenge.\nHis squad has several key players missing through injury, but those who have stepped in to replace them have stepped up.\nThey look more assured at the back and have a cutting edge up front â€“ a combination Thelin will be hoping can get them over the line.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czd34d1g7qro"}
