Gatland is due to announce his squad after the final game against South Africa, having said this week he only knew one of his squad and places were up for grabs.\nA turbulent 12 months had seen Wales lose nine out of 12 games as Gatland returned for a second stint in place of Wayne Pivac.\nA fifth-placed finish in the Six Nations was followed by the loss of the experienced Alun Wyn Jones, Justin Tipuric, Rhys Webb and Ken Owens and off-the-field controversy with players threatening to strike over contractual injuries.\nGatland has spoken about changing the negative narrative surrounding Welsh rugby and he will hope this win starts that process.\nAfter tough training camps in Switzerland and Turkey, there were Test debuts for centre Max Llewellyn and Cardiff props Corey Domachowski and Keiron Assiratti.\nThe prop duo struggled in the scrums in the first half with three set-piece penalties conceded between them, but they will have learned from the experience and Gatland believes some of the decisions against them were unjustified.\nFlanker Taine Plumtree and former England prop Henry Thomas also impressed as they made their Wales debuts off the replacements bench.\nFly-half Sam Costelow made his first start and provided a threat to the English defence typified by almost releasing Louis Rees-Zammit for a first half try. Wing Rees-Zammit was also denied a late try after almost creating a brilliant individual score for himself.\nCostelow's clever cross-kick also set up a try for Scarlets scrum-half Davies. Aaron Wainwright gathered possession before feeding Morgan who released Davies to score.\nThe fly-half might have proved suspect under the high ball on a couple of occasions, but that will be balanced by his attacking ability that will offer extra options to the experience of Dan Biggar and Gareth Anscombe.\nInjuries were always going to create problems and Wales hooker Ryan Elias and lock Dafydd Jenkins will provide Gatland with some concern.\nElias was forced off the field after just six minutes with a hamstring injury. He had already missed the Six Nations because of an Achilles problem.\nAnother Scarlets hooker, Owens, has already been ruled out of at least the tournament group stages with a back problem leaving Elliot Dee, Lake and Sam Parry as the three remaining hookers in the squad.\nJenkins limped off in the second half which forced a major reshuffle with centre Mason Grady slipping into the back row because all forward replacements had been used before North later switched to the flank.\nWales were not hampered, though, and Grady almost scored with his first touch before being denied by England captain Ellis Genge in the corner.\nThat resourcefulness typified Wales' second-half display and set up their success.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/66412166"}
