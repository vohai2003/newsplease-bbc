It's unfortunate, but there's no malice and I don't think he's out of control or reckless, so we'll see,\" Williams said.\nSwansea's appeal has failed, however, meaning Darling will miss Saturday's trip to Norwich City as well as the home fixture with Coventry City on 1 February and the game at Bristol City eight days later.\nDarling's suspension leaves Swansea with only one out-and-out central defender, Ben Cabango, although they are hoping to sign Burnley's Hannes Lacroix on loan in time for the weekend.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c17ewgng2vwo"}
