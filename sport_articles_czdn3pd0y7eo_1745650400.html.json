Thelin described McGrath as a \"good player\" but \"it is what it is\".\nThelin feels there are positives to take from the 5-1 loss at Celtic Park last time out, but says they have to defend better.\nThe Swede says the past four or five games show the Dons \"are more stable and more clear\" after ending the their long winless run. His players can feel the competition for places which has made training more intense.\nWith just five matches until the split, Thelin stressed that \"every game now is so important\", and \"the pressure is there\". He is hoping for a \"really good Sunday\" at Pittodrie.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/czdn3pd0y7eo"}
