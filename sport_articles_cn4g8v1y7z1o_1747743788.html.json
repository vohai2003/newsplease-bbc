Georginio Rutter has a core injury and will definitely miss Sunday and the cup game.\"\nHe is however confident Rutter will make a speedy recovery: \"I hope he will be able to play a few games before the international break and think that will work out.\"\nFarke also updated on the injury status of some of his other players: \"Mateo [Joseph] rolled his ankle and will miss three to four weeks. Tyler [Adams] is not too far away from training while Jack {Harrison] is a bit further away.\"\nHe is excited about taking charge of Leeds for the first time in a competitive game: \"I knew what a massive club this was and the expectations that come with it. In a positive way, I've been surprised by the reaction of my lads. They've stuck together and worked hard.\"\nOn the start of a new season: \"The first game is always exciting and at Elland Road, it will be even more special. Now the real stuff begins and we are all looking forward to it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn4g8v1y7z1o"}
