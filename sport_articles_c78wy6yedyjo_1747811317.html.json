He and Barkley had three rushing touchdowns each, and Hurts had a touchdown pass too.\nBut I think this is a huge game for him because if you look at the one person who has the most pressure on them, it is Hurts. It isn't Barkley, it isn't the Eagles' offensive line - those guys have been terrific - and they've got the number one defence.\nThe Chiefs don't have stress on them because if they don't win, well they've gotten to the Super Bowl five times [in six years]. I think Hurts is going to bear the brunt of it. He's the guy that is going to be the reason why the Eagles win or lose.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c78wy6yedyjo"}
