We're realistic and we all know we need to strengthen the squad, more or less, in all areas.\n\"We need to strengthen the centre-half position, full-back, physicality in midfield, creativity in midfield, and firepower up front. So there are many wishes, but we also have to stay financially disciplined after relegation.\"\nThe Whites will begin their fight for promotion back to the top flight against Cardiff City on Sunday, 6 August (14:30 BST) but Farke could be without up to nine injured players for his first game in charge.\nThe German manager will be missing several key players, including Patrick Bamford, Georginio Rutter, Tyler Adams and Jack Harrison.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx0we208y7ko"}
