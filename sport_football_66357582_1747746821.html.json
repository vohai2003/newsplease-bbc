In fact, it grew even louder.\nPauw, whose contract expires after the tournament, has reiterated her desire to stay but that renewal, which looked at one stage like it would be signed and sealed before the World Cup, has yet to arrive.\nNow it looks increasingly unlikely it ever will.\nThere is undoubtedly baggage from the allegations levelled at her in an article by The Athletic on the eve of the tournament.\nPauw has been steadfast in strenuously denying claims of being abusive in previous employment and said she had done nothing wrong. The Football Association of Ireland backed her when the initial allegations came out in December, and said full focus was on the World Cup when fresh claims emerged.\nPauw took a pop at the FAI in Ireland's latest pre-match press conference, saying she and the players deserved clarity over her future and if it was unfair members of the team were being questioned on it.\nFor what it is worth, players, at various media events before and during the tournament, have not exactly given the 60-year-old a full backing. Again, sometimes what isn't said speaks the loudest.\nThen, after the Nigeria game, it was revealed by Pauw that captain Katie McCabe had requested \"fresh legs\" long before the manager made her first substitution in the 84th minute.\nPauw said she had no problem with that, stating: \"A player can say anything to the coach, at least to me.\" But, what happened next again suggested that all was not well in camp.\nA tweet was all it took from McCabe. A zipped face emoji. You can read into that whatever you want.\nIn the feisty press conference in July where Pauw put in a staunch defence of her own character, McCabe said she had \"clashed\" with her manager in the past, but it was always professional. This time it has been rather more public.\nIt's a shame that any disagreements have slipped into the public domain. Ultimately, we are left with more questions than answers.\nHow do the Republic of Ireland reflect on the tournament? Ultimately, it's a case of what could have been.\nThe Irish were drawn in arguably the toughest group of them all, with co-hosts Australia, Olympic champions Canada and Nigeria, who are the top African side and the best fourth seeds.\nThe opening defeat by Australia, who the Republic had frustrated for the first half, was down to a clumsy tackle in the area. Matildas captain Steph Catley did the rest from the penalty spot.\nThe second game in Perth against Canada gave more grounds for optimism. McCabe scored her wonder goal from a corner in the fourth minute, and for the majority of the first half Ireland were well on top.\nHowever, the Olympic champions hit back to eliminate the Irish with a game still to play.\nThe draw with the Nigerians was flat. The African side had all but qualified and, thanks to Australia's stunning win over Canada, were happy to sit back. The Republic could not break them down, and that has been a common feature of this team with their defensive set-up.\nIt says a lot about this team, and the progress they have made, that they have been so disappointed by such small margins.\nIt has been a learning process for everyone involved, and such has been the performances it would be a huge surprise not to see this Republic team qualify for another major tournament, whether that be the Euros in 2025 or the next World Cup.\nUnlike neighbours Northern Ireland, who the Republic of Ireland play at the Aviva Stadium in September, a swift decision on Pauw's future - no matter what way it goes - is crucial to keep up the momentum that has been built in this tournament.\nPauw, however, was adamant that she will be in charge.\n\"I don't feel this is my last game because we are going home from a World Cup,\" she defiantly said, also addressing her attendance at Thursday's homecoming event in Dublin.\n\"Why would I not be at the homecoming? I go back with my team. Otherwise I would have stayed here and enjoyed the World Cup.\"\nWhile the immediate aftermath will be focused on the fallout in Brisbane, there are brighter things on the horizon.\nAfter qualifying for their first major tournament, attention will be on September's Nations League homecoming with Northern Ireland at the Aviva Stadium - no matter who is in the dugout.\nThe Nations League is swiftly followed by qualifying for Euro 2025 and the marker has already been laid down - the team have to back it up with qualification.\nIt's a great chance to build momentum and ensure the green jerseys will be running out in Switzerland in the summer after next.\nThe stand taken by the team in 2017, where they threatened strike action over conditions, was the turning point. Now this World Cup has to lay the foundations for more success and progress.\nAll eyes are on the future, whatever that may hold for Pauw and this group of players.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66357582"}
