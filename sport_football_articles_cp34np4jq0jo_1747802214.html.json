He is key for them.\nYou only have to look at Manchester City's Ederson, who has not been up to his usual standards this year, to see what effect that has had on their form and the rest of the team.\nThen, of course, there is Mohamed Salah. His stats speak for themselves but there are, however, question marks over him and Virgil van Dijk, who has also had a really solid season.\nI believe the midfielders have been key to how Liverpool have played this season and they have controlled the tempo of most games, which is different to how Jurgen Klopp had them playing before.\nUnder Arne Slot, they are more controlled in possession and that is a lot to do with Ryan Gravenberch in that midfield role. We knew he was talented but under Klopp he didn't get a run of games, so he is the surprise package of the season for them as he has made that position his own.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp34np4jq0jo"}
