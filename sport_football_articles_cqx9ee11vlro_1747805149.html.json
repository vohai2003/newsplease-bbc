That was really enticing for me - and I cannot deny I also want to win trophies.\"\nDirector of football, Txiki Begiristain added: \"Omar is an accomplished and exciting forward, and I'm delighted he's joining us.\n\"He's had an outstanding season, and every time we have watched him, he has influenced matches. He has all the attributes a top-class attacker requires.\n\"He can also play a number of different positions, which is a really valuable asset.\"\nWhat do you think?\nIn the past week, City have spent £121m and secured Erling Haaland on a contract until 2034. So, is the rebuild complete?\nOr is more required to climb back to the top of the Premier League and Europe?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqx9ee11vlro"}
