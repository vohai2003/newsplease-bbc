We are moving slowly, but we are moving and that's the most important thing.\n\"We've had challenging days behind us, if you lose the game 5-0 just a couple of days ago and then you know you have to come to Sunderland facing one of the strongest teams, especially here.\n\"It takes courage, and I'm very happy that we showed this reaction and we showed this character.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c78wj1wn75vt"}
