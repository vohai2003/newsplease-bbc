I am thrilled to see him lead this team.\"\nGlenn, who has had stints with the Lions, New Orleans Saints and Cleveland Browns, has never been a head coach.\n\"This place is special for me,\" said Glenn.\n\"From the time I was drafted and practiced on Long Island, to the time I came back as a scout in New Jersey, this organisation has always felt like home.\"\nGlenn succeeds Robert Saleh, who became the first coach in owner Johnson's 25-year tenure to be sacked by the Jets in October.\nThe Jets last qualified for the post-season in 2010.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c5yvg7vn5gjo"}
