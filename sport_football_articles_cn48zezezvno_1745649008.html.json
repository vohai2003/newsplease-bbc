However, Wan-Bissaka is already two thirds of the way to his best Premier League return of six goal involvements in 2020-21, with 13 matches still to play,\nIndeed, the 27-year-old has become one of the Hammers' most important creative outlets, illustrated by his fine assist for Jarrod Bowen's winner against Arsenal on Saturday.\nIn a turbulent season in east London, Wan-Bissaka has consistently ranked closely with star attackers Bowen and Mohammed Kudus in several key metrics.\nHe is crucial in driving his team forward, shown by him leading the squad for progressive carries [76] and carries into the final third [44], while his 10 crosses into the penalty area is level at the top alongside Kudus.\nPerhaps more surprisingly, he has 40 successful take-ons, behind only Kudus' 64 and ahead of Bowen's 35, suggesting a willingness to get at his opponent.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cn48zezezvno"}
