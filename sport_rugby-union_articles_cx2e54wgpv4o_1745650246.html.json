The pot was already boiling.\n\"If we are now in the business of urging people how to vote rather than letting them make up their own minds, we would say, 'Vote for change before it's too late. These people are not on your team'.\"\nFormer England captain Beaumont reiterated that the board, with whom the chief executive's fate ultimately rests, support Sweeney staying in his post.\n\"Any decision relating to the employment of the CEO is the responsibility of the RFU Board and the Board unanimously supports Bill Sweeney remaining as CEO,\" he wrote.\n\"This support is based on his achievements to date, as well as his ability to deliver the RFU's strategy while being highly motivated to respond and react to what we have heard from you, our members.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx2e54wgpv4o"}
