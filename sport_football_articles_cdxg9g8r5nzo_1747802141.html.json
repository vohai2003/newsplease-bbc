Everton defended so well against Liverpool on Wednesday, and they carried a real threat too, with Beto running in behind.\nBukayo Saka was back for the Gunners against Fulham and he will obviously boost their attack but they have picked up a few defensive injuries, including Gabriel being out for the rest of the season.\nMikel Arteta's side have got Tuesday's Champions League tie with Real Madrid to think about and, on top of that, this is an early kick-off to deal with too. None of that helps.\nI want Arsenal to keep on winning to put some pressure on Liverpool but Everton drew 0-0 at Emirates Stadium in December, when Sean Dyche was in charge, and everything points towards a similar outcome this time.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdxg9g8r5nzo"}
