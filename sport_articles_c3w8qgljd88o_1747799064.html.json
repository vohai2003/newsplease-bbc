We had a game plan and the boys stuck to it,\" he said. \"Losing the late goal is gutting. But, overall, it was a good night.\n\"The boys really stuck together. It gives us belief going forward. Massive game next [Dundee United in the cup], but we look forward to it.\n\"We have got to take confidence from that game going forward.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3w8qgljd88o"}
