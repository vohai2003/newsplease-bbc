It was a solid team performance. There was a lot going on in the game, lots of ups and downs, but we stuck with it. I'm so proud of the lads.\n\"Newcastle can always put you under pressure. They are very dangerous but we stuck to our guns and we put in a great shift.\n\"I'm feeling very good, feeling fit and feeling strong - thanks to my mum and dad for giving me good genes.\"\nOn Brighton's chances of winning the FA Cup: \"It is going to be really tough.\"\nOn Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler: \"I think he knows that whenever I'm on the bench, I'm going to be analysing and making sure I can have an impact. I tried to do my best and thankfully I got the winning goal.\n\"We have got to push on. There's a lot more to come from us as a team. It is exciting times and we are looking forward to finishing strong.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c201xw2e4pro"}
