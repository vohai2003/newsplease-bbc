They might try to do a permanent deal - I think the Premier League clubs are probably the only clubs in the world that have the money to try to make this happen.\n\"Real Madrid have spent a lot of money on Jude Bellingham this summer, they haven't got the money this year and may try to do a loan deal with an obligation to buy next year.\n\"Chelsea need a centre-forward, there's a lot of doubt over Romelu Lukaku's future and I think he will go again. I will categorise this in the 'one to watch' but I think Mbappe will be on the move somewhere and it could be Chelsea, but I'm not saying definitely Chelsea.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cp37rmx10vpo"}
