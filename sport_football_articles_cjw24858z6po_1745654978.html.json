We have handled teams who play man-to-man really well.\n\"We are not going to try to adapt. When we have the squad, we can play in this way. As long as I am the manager, we are going to adjust depending on the quality of player, but we are going to try to play the way that defined that team for many years that had the success.\n\"The only difference is that there were more teams in the past who were cautious. Now the teams are so brave so that is a little bit different.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cjw24858z6po"}
