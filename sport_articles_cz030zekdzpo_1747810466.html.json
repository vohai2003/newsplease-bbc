Hearts troubled Celtic, with Elton Kabangu a nuisance and chances created.\nTheir shape, though, meant they were likely to be exposed at times and so it proved.\nCallum McGregor was afforded too much space for the opener and that allowed Daizen Maeda to escape in behind all to easily.\nHe got in behind again way too easily for the second and for the third, with the Hearts defence looking brutally open after failing to stop Celtic countering at pace.\nThe game was done at half-time but not for the want of trying.\nHearts remain sixth and still have a Scottish Cup semi-final to contest. Earlier this season, most supporters would have taken that.\nTwo fixtures at home to Dundee United and at Motherwell will determine which half of the table they finish in. Given where they have come from this season, they will likely tackle those games with confidence.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz030zekdzpo"}
