It was really hard to pick the group up.\n\"They lads were devastated because Paul's a good guy and the lads really respected and liked him. But he was fully aware that the run results haven't been good enough.\n\"I thought we had the better opportunities and could easily have come away with three points.\n\"The club and fans are amazing. I'm really pleased that the fans have something to shout about rather than just doom and gloom. Today is a really good, positive day.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0qwyl892kko"}
