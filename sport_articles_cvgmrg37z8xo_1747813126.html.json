We suddenly carried a goal threat and fully merited the point although we were also denied a stonewall penalty.\nDanny Armstrong looked a bit more like his old self when he came on and gave us an extra spark on the right-hand side.\nKyle Vassell has been largely ineffective for us this season and I genuinely feel his game would benefit if he had a similar spell on the bench.\nNext up is a misfiring Aberdeen on Boxing Day and we have nothing to fear on current form. Merry Christmas to Killie fans wherever you are.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvgmrg37z8xo"}
