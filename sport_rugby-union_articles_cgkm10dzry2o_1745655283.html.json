We're not going to focus on that [breaking records], we'll focus on the France game first.\"\nIreland's Garry Ringrose was shown a 20-minute red card in the first half in Cardiff and visitors fought back from 18-10 down to earn victory.\n\"It shows how much belief we have as a team. We made a few errors in the first half and let Wales back into the game,\" added Osborne.\n\"We were down at the break, but there was no real panic in the dressing room, everyone just thought to go back to basics, clean up accuracy and errors and we did that thankfully.\n\"Most of the team are very experienced and there have been a number of games where they have had to overcome a bit of adversity, and it shows we have what it takes to overcome those kinds of things.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/articles/cgkm10dzry2o"}
