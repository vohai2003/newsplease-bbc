He has scored all of his goals while playing as a number nine and his calm finishing has been noticeable. He has seemed to take every chance that has come his way.\nHis versatility and ability to play in the number 10 role or on either wing means he can be partnered with Jackson, something Pochettino tried again against Dortmund.\nSenegal forward Jackson scored 13 goals in 38 appearances for Villarreal last season, including nine in their final eight league games, and was close to joining Bournemouth in January.\nIn the USA, he took to the Chelsea team seamlessly, scoring two goals and getting three assists.\nHe is excellent at holding the ball up, good at running in behind defences and, as well as his goals, he seems able to pick the right pass in the final third.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx7ywgv7ld3o"}
