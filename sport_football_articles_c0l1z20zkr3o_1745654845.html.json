I didn't have a good game. I didn't take my chances. So what? On to the next one'.\n\"That's the thing about him and that's why I'm not concerned because he's so good a player and has such good quality, so it'll come.\"\nEx-Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison added: \"All he needs is one goal. Once he gets one, he will be back on it again.\n\"Even the best players can suffer what he's going through at the moment, but do you know what I like about him? He still gets in there.\n\"It's when you start hiding and not getting in there that there is a problem. But he still wants to get in there and create chances. Once he gets one, he'll go on a good run again.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c0l1z20zkr3o"}
