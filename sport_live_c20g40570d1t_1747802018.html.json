There is no other way to put it.\nDavy Fitzgerald now has the task of raising the morale of his players for the home tussle in two weeks against a Waterford side most reckoned as odds-on promotion favourites before the action started last month.\nGranted Waterford then lost their opener to Carlow but they opened their account by beating Laois 1-27 to 0-20 today.\nSo it's going to be tough against the Deise in Corrigan Park before the Saffrons' final two games against Carlow (away) and Laois (home).\nYou can further pour over the entrails of today's contest by taking a look at our match report which has just been published.\nThanks for your company today.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/c20g40570d1t"}
