It cannot be right that people fear being on the electoral registers because of decades-old debt relating to a discredited and unjust tax. Nor is it right that some of the few people paying off poll tax debt are the poorest in society.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-31533524"}
