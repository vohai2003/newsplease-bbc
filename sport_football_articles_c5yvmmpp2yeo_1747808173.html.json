We didn't start well. We were very bad in the first 30 minutes but in the last 15 minutes much better. The second half was like a disaster.\"\nOn what went so wrong for Southampton: \"There were only 15 minutes where we played well - we pressed high, stole the ball, tried to create chances but, in every situation, they were better than us. Everything.\n\"Nothing to say, really bad. We conceded really stupid goals. Psychologically, we are really down and I think in this moment we have to be all together.\n\"It is our fault, my fault as the manager, and we have to understand the situation but stay together and try to do better next time.\"\nOn whether the team is worse than he thought before he took charge: \"We can compete with the others. We played such a good game against West Ham. After today, there was such a difference between us and them.\"\nOn the fans being annoyed that he took Kamaldeen Sulemana off: \"Sulemana hasn't played for a long time. He did 55 minutes and he was not bad.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yvmmpp2yeo"}
