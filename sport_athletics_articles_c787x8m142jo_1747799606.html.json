We would love to see more spectators here, you know?\" Johnson said.\n\"We think we'll get that, we think that'll happen. But the crowd was engaged, and that's what's really important. People were really engaged with what's happening here.\"\nAmerican Johnson said he launched the concept, broadcast on TNT Sports in the UK, in a bid to maintain the attention and excitement athletics generates every four years at the Olympics.\nThe event in Jamaica was the first of four scheduled three-day events - each of the next three take place in the United States - and Johnson was pleased with how it played out, although he admitted there are issues to iron out.\n\"Everything went smooth from a competition standpoint,\" Johnson added. \"But we had a few things behind the scenes that we didn't like.\n\"Other people probably didn't notice it, but we did. We will look at everything. We noticed lots of different things. But those aren't the things we're going to get into right now.\n\"Right now we're just celebrating that we had a great event, athletes and fans enjoyed it. We'll continue to improve.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/articles/c787x8m142jo"}
