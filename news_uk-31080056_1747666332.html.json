We stand ready to provide support at this difficult time, if it is requested,\" said a spokesman in the British embassy in the Indonesian capital Jakarta.\n\"The UK strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances without exception. We have made representations about the death penalty to the Indonesian government, and we will continue to do so.\"\nLast year, Sandiford challenged the UK's government's policy not to fund Britons facing capital charges abroad.\nAlthough the UK's top court dismissed the appeal, the judges called on the government to look at her case \"urgently\".\nThe Supreme Court's written ruling said \"the local courts seem to have ignored the substantial mitigating factors in her case\".\nThe judges cited age, mental problems, lack of previous criminal record and co-operation with police.\nThey said there was a \"remarkable disparity of her sentence with those members of the syndicate whom she helped to bring to justice\".\nThe BBC's Karishma Vaswani said Indonesia had some of the toughest drug laws in the world, and last month it executed six people - including five foreigners - on drug related offences.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo had recently declared he would reject all clemency appeals from drug convicts, she added.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31080056"}
