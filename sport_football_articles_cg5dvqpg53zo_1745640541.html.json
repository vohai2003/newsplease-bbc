I think we deserved to win after 90 minutes. Of course, with penalties, it is sometimes a lottery. Luckily we won.\n\"The goalkeeping coach told me a couple of bits of information, but my feeling is more important. I went the wrong way three times, but credit to our penalty takers. It is not easy. A brilliant job from all of us.\"\nOn wanting to reach Wembley: \"100%. Two-years ago, we lost in the quarter final [against Manchester United] and now we are in the quarter-finals again.\n\"We want to go to Wembley 100%.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cg5dvqpg53zo"}
