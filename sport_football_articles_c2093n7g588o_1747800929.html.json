We started dominating. They were playing tactically, a medium-low block, and we started dominating because they were not pressing high and not getting out. We were creating chances and we scored goals.\n\"In the second half, I am not happy. They were changing their tactics, taking more duels on aggressively and pressing higher, and we were not dominating like we have to.\n\"This victory is very important. I'm very happy with the victory. I'm very demanding of myself to improve things within the game. I'm happy because we have three more points.\"\nOn playing in the Champions League next week: \"We are going to play two matches, the first in Paris and then coming back here. Of course we are going to prepare for the two matches, but it is completely different from the game we played today.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2093n7g588o"}
