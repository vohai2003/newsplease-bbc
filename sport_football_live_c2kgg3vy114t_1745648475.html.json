Rob Street then drew a good save from Grant Smith as the away side made all the early running.\nHowever, it was Bromley who took the lead with their only shot on target, Brooklyn Ilunga's cross sidefooted home by Elerewe.\nDoncaster continued to press and Smith had to be alert again, keeping out efforts from Street and Jordan Gibson just before the interval.\nThe second 45 saw a similar pattern of play. Luke Molyneux struck the Bromley crossbar on the hour mark and as the game entered the final quarter Smith continued his personal quest to deny Doncaster, saving from Street, Gibson and Molyneux in quick succession.\nAs the game entered 10 minutes of additional time, Rovers' Billy Sharp shot narrowly wide but Bromley defended heroically to hold on to the three points.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c2kgg3vy114t"}
