And thankfully, Paqueta was there to score.\n\"He is a matchwinner for us, as simple as that. He's got that quality and his work rate is also great. He played the whole game chasing the ball. Sometimes, with this much talent, we don't often see that side. He's top quality.\"\nOn working with Graham Potter: \"He asked us to be brave to play. If you make mistakes, they are mistakes. You are human. It's about how you react.\n\"We competed from the start to finish. We haven't had much time working together but it is a very, very positive start. In the game against Aston Villa, we did really well for long periods and tonight, we showed great character to win three points tonight.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c983dx7yj31o"}
