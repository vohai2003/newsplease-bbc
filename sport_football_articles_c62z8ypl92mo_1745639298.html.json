If we do what we know we can do, in the end we will be close to winning it - but we don't have to focus too much about it.\n\"We have to be proud but at the same time think about the next game. It is coming real soon and we need to show the same mentality.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c62z8ypl92mo"}
