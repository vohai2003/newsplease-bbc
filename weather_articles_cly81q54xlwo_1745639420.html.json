The last similar cyclone to take such a route was Zoe way back in 1974.\nPreparations are under way for the arrival of torrential rain which will cause flooding, damaging winds and battering waves with conditions set to deteriorate significantly over the next few days.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/cly81q54xlwo"}
