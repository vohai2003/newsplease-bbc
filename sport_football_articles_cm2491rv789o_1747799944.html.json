When they brought him on, within six minutes he'd showed everyone what he's about.\n\"You have to get balls into the box and that's exactly what happened. It's a wonderful header - the timing of the jump and the power behind it. Then West Ham were a better team with him.\n\"They looked a little light up top in the first half, but in the second half they posed a different threat. Jarrod Bowen and Fullkrug had a good understanding of each other, one was going long and one was going short.\n\"The problem that they have is that he's only had one 90 minutes, three starts and the three goals. But when he came on, it was a completely different game.\n\"They've got to somehow keep him fit because they're a better team with him up there, and he makes other players better as well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2491rv789o"}
