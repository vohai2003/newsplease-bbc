That is one-in-a-million and then in the end we had good chances. We performed well and then the fine margins didn't go our way.\n\"Even game, could have gone either way but unfortunately we didn't.\n\"The last one I don't think it was a penalty but the first one I think it was.\"\nOn Bryan Mbeumo scoring again: \"First with Ivan [Toney] I said we had the best penalty taker in the world and with Bryan, if not the best, we have the second best.\n\"If we keep performing like this, I think we will be in a good position at the end of the season. Hopefully we get five straight home wins now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3wxqd9py4zo"}
