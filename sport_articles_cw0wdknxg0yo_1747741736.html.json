Most fans would not have been surprised/upset if he had been offloaded but credit to the manager. He knew there was a player in there and he is getting performances out of him. Concerned we might still lose some of our talent before the transfer window closes.\nChris: Brilliant first half, we look a lot more assured and calm on the ball - no longer lumping it aimlessly forward. The Hibs comeback was tough to take but what character and class we showed to pinch it at the end. Alex Grieve deserves to start more games. Iâ€™m really hoping to build on last year and push for Europe!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cw0wdknxg0yo"}
