When you consider how Chelsea played and we played, I don't think we deserved to win. Cucurella is touching Semenyo and they scored. It should be changed. What do you have to check? I don't think we were better than Chelsea.\"\nOn David Brooks challenge: \"It was not violent. he just tries to grab him. It is not something violent. I don't understand why VAR gets involved in these things. I don't understand a lot of things from the referee today.\n\"I think first half they were playing like they were Chelsea and they were much better than us. We cannot play as slow as we were playing. I'm disappointed with the first half because we haven't seen the team we've been all season.\n\"Justin Kluivert is a strange one because with 25 players available he probably would have started. I wanted to have someone who could have improved from the bench.\n\"We have to analyse. Every game is different Chelsea are a very good team. I am happy for the players who have played in that number nine position.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr53mgyjy8no"}
