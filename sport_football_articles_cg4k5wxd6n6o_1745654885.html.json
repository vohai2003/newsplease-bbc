When he is involved, he's such a big threat.\"\nOn Blackburn and new manager Valerien Ismael. \"I'm sorry to my analysis department as we needed to watch lots of his games. If we play to our best it should be about us.\"\n\"Everything is an opportunity for us at the moment. Saturday is another game in the league and we have to do our best.
