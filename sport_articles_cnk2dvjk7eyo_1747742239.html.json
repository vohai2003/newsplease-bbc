He just needs a little bit of time and support to reach that potential.\nTerry: He's young enough to mould and learn, might take a season to settle. We need somebody in the box, a target to score goals but also make space and take defenders out for others. We also need 10-15 goals from Antony, Garnacho and Sancho to be title challengers.\nRoyston: Hojlund is a rough diamond, a very expensive one in my view. Given his physical attributes and footballing ability, Ten Hag must have seen something in this boy to become a top striker and fits well in his system. Not concerned that he hasn't got a great goal record now but with the creative force United have, the goals should flow.\nPaul: We spent Â£30m on Rooney at 18. The price is the price. Yes it's inflated, but the whole industry is inflated prices.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cnk2dvjk7eyo"}
