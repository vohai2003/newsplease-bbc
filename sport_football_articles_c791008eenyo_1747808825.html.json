It was a tough win, but a massive one. There is no denying that the ball hit Joe's hand or arm, but I'm not sure of the rules.\"\nOn whether Dan Burn should have been sent off: \"Not for me. I don't think he warranted two yellow cards. His yellow card probably was one but, after that, they were slight fouls.\"\nOn goalscorer Alexander Isak: \"He was in the right place at the right time. That is an art. Another good cross from Jacob [Murphy]. He will be disappointed with the one he didn't take. He is on a hot streak, long may that continue.\"\nOn their current form: \"Our confidence has definitely shifted, it naturally does when you win games. It was something we were building to, the performances were good.\n\"We are a very good team with good players. I would like to think that we can keep it going.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c791008eenyo"}
