If Greece goes, the eurozone would need to demonstrate greater financial solidarity between rich Northern European economies and overstretched southern ones.\nThat would be necessary to persuade investors and businesses not to withdraw vital funds from those economies thought most likely to follow Greece out of the eurozone.\nAnd of course as the biggest eurozone economy by far it would be Germany which would be expected to make the biggest contribution to any expanded bailout fund and to increasing the firepower of the European Central Bank.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31541920"}
