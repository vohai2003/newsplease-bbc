I think that will be the key [for Sunday].\"\nRasmus Hojgaard, Daniel Berger, Jordan Spieth and Michael Kim are all tied second on 13 under.\nScotland's Robert MacIntyre matched Detry's round of 65 and is seven shots off the lead, with world number one Scottie Scheffler a further shot behind.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/czxkqgn2ry5o"}
