We shouldn't have conceded the first goal, that shouldn't happen to us, but you can see a lot of character in the boys.\n\"We need to be more consistent. We have a really young team. The average age of our team is 23 years old. It is tough sometimes, but our guys fight for everything. Maybe you need a bit more experience to manage the game.\n\"In some parts, we are really good. Consistency is an important thing for us to get back where we need to be.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjdnmk0vrylo"}
