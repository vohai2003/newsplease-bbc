We were dominated by the better team. We dug in in the second half but it is a sad day and one that this group of players will learn from.\n\"We need wins, points, performances. It has to come to a point where the fans are happy and singing. Fair play to those [fans] who came today, have been at Saint Mary's and travelled around the country. We have to build some momentum going in to the Championship season.\"\nOn trying to go past Derby's 11-point record: \"We want to get as many points as we can until the end of the season. No-one wants that record and we will do what we can to get more points on the board.\"\nOn his saves: \"Something like that can hopefully spark a period in the game. I'm there to try and save as many as possible but we have fallen short today and during the season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgm8yl9y3lko"}
