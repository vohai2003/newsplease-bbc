But he did not give any further details on how that might work.\nThe Biden administration had argued that TikTok, which has 170 million US users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.\nOpponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.\nIn 2018, Meta launched a standalone app called Lasso to compete with TikTok but it was later shut down.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgwwd09vwzo"}
