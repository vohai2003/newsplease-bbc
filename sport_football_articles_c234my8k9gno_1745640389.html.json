The four best runners-up from the nine groups will have a second chance via the play-offs.\nMcCarthy, who is South Africa's all-time record goalscorer, represented his nation at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, but Kenya have never qualified for the competition.\nMcCarthy is among the most recognisable names in African football, having carved out a successful playing career in Europe.\nHe won Dutch league and cup titles with Ajax before repeating the trick in Portugal with Jose Mourinho's Porto, also adding the 2004 Champions League title to his trophy haul.\nThe former striker then spent five years in the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers and West Ham before finishing his playing days back in South Africa with Orlando Pirates.\nHe began his coaching career as an assistant with Belgian club Sint-Truiden before taking charge of both Cape Town City and AmaZulu in his homeland.\nMost recently, he was part of Erik ten Hag's backroom team at Manchester United.\n\"I was given an incredible opportunity to go work with one of the biggest and best clubs in the world,\" he said of his time at Old Trafford.\n\"I just felt the time was right now for me to go on and do what I love most, and that's to be manager and to help players grow.\n\"When this opportunity (to coach Kenya) came, I thought where better to give back to the continent that's given me everything?\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c234my8k9gno"}
