Obviously, we have added a lot of strength and experience to that area of the pitch over the summer, so this opportunity at Stockport is perfect.\n“Jayden still has almost two years of his current deal still remaining at Aberdeen, so we will closely monitor his progress in the weeks and months ahead.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cd1jqjey58ko"}
