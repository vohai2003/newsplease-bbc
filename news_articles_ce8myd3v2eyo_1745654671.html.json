Two further drop-in sessions were held earlier this month.\nThe report said it did not \"speak for all residents, but certainly a significant number of them\".\nThe report said: \"For some households, living in Barton House will never feel safe again no matter how many internal repairs are carried out.\n\"Adults and children are triggered by the smallest reminder of the fragility of the building â€“ cracks in the walls, fire alarms malfunctioning, broken lifts.\n\"Many households have spent years waiting for their turn to move through the council's banding system. They have asked the council time and time again to be rehoused, but they have been ignored.\n\"The result has been generations of people forced to live in a building that they feel is a constant threat to their lives.\"\nCouncillor Barry Parsons, chair of the council's homes and housing delivery committee, apologised to residents and said an independent investigation would take place.\n\"The pace of change seems to be glacially slow and I know how upsetting that is for everyone and how angry it makes people and I'm really sorry for that,\" he said.\n\"It's clear that we need to look at the circumstances that led to the evacuation of Barton House, the wider context of it, as well as the traumatic experiences of that day and the subsequent few weeks as well.\"\nMr Parsons said he had commissioned a review of rehousing options for people affected.\n\"I was at Barton House during the evening of the evacuation and visited families who had to leave their homes in the weeks afterwards, so I saw first-hand some of the shock and distress that residents felt,\" he said.\nThe authority's priority was ensuring the health and wellbeing of all residents in council housing was supported and \"we are living up to our promise to ensure they live in safe and decent homes\".\nThe council would consider the conclusions and recommendations over the coming weeks, he added, before issuing a formal response by the end of March and \"updating residents on the actions we will take\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8myd3v2eyo"}
