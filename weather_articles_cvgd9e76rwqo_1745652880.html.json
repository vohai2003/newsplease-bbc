The impact can be seen not only over the snow-covered landscape, but also the frozen surface of parts of the Great Lakes.\nLake Erie, the shallowest of the lakes, is experiencing one of the highest levels of ice cover recorded in the last ten years.\nHow much ice forms on the lake varies from year to year. This year, ice is covering over 95% of the lake's surface, roughly an area the size of Wales. That's substantially above the average of around 67% for this stage in the year and far surpassing conditions of the last three years.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/cvgd9e76rwqo"}
