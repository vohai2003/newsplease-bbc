We're not there yet, but if you look at the table, there's seven games and you can almost taste it.\n\"Looking at the fixtures ahead, there's not too many big challenges. The pathway is there and they just need to stay focused and not get carried away.\n\"It's completely surprised everyone that they're in this position - but deservedly so.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn8vlgyp501o"}
