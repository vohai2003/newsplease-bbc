He obviously wants to get out of Brentford that's clear.\n\"I don't think that great for Brentford supporters given what he's done for them and how the club gave him a chance in the Premier League, so it's very much self interest and a bit of ruthlessness there.\n\"There's this idea they're going to have two number ones at Arsenal, which is a bit like having two girlfriends.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg3wxw03980o"}
