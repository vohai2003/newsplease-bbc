I want all my letters destroyed. Please darling do this for me. Til then and forever I worship you.\"\nAlthough the couple wrote throughout the war, the letters stopped in 1945.\nPerhaps most poignantly, one of them contained the lines: \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if all our letters could be published in the future in a more enlightened time. Then all the world could see how in love we are.\"\nMr Vallentine said after seeing the BBC article he flew to Oswestry to meet museum creator Mark Hignett who had been instrumental in gathering the letters and also discovering that they were between two men.\nGordon Bowsher had only used the inital G in his letters.\nMr Vallentine convinced Mr Hignett to give him the rights to Gilbert and Gordon's story for a feature film.\n\"For me, what is the most unique aspect, is just the amount of letters that Gilbert kept,\" said Mr Vallentine.\n\"Gay people have been around always, we have always been hereâ€¦ mostly we've been in the closet, most gay people would burn letters or destroy them out of fear of discovery.\n\"It's just such a important historical moment in the broad gay community that we have this insight into what a relationship looked like for these men at that time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx299217n1go"}
