The only thing I'm happy about is that I didn't make the step from Ajax to here, because maybe then it would've been too much.\n\"I had some experience in Italy. During the first three months, the pressure was really big because I was signed for Â£75 million and I couldn't make a mistake.\n\"So, I learned by failure and disappointment to deal with the critics - that helps me a lot in the situation we are in this year.\"\nThe Dutch international has played in all but two of United's Premier League games this season, starting the past five games in all competitions, but he knows the club's form needs to change swiftly.\n\"Football is a really strange sport,\" he said. \"It can change out of nowhere - sometimes it's about finding the right formula.\n\"At the moment we are not there, but I keep my hopes up that we will find it really soon.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c05l7me36v5o"}
