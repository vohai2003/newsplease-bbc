They had a big chance in the end and that could have been a lot worse than where we are now. I'm definitely disappointed with dropping points at home, but it is what is and we have to move on and we will.\n\"We found the 2-1 and then it is about trying to manage the game and keep the ball for longer than three and four passes. We lost the ball too easily at times and then we were more open than we should have been.\n\"We are not perfect, we are still learning and we have to learn from this as well.\"\nOn whether they came into the game underestimating Manchester United: \"That's all the media - media talk. It's nothing to do with us. We prepared for a very tough game like we have seen today. We didn't think any of that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c86wzv548n6o"}
