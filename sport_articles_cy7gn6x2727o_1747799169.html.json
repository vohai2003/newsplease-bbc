I think you can see now that we are getting the benefits from that.\n\"We are also getting benefits from the partnership we have with Burnley in terms of (Oluwaseun) Adewumi's level of performance at the moment, so huge credit to the club for making sure there is no stone unturned in our search to try and develop the team and improve the team.\"\nDespite being ravaged by injury and illness in recent weeks, Dundee travel to play champions Celtic on Saturday in excellent form.\nThey have lost just one of their past six games, a run which includes back-to-back draws with both the Old Firm and a Scottish Cup victory over neighbours United.\nDocherty said: \"It is a brand new group, we have been developing as a group, there are young players that are developing.\n\"And now that we have got incomings, the four are strong signings and the injuries â€“ (Joe) Shaughnessy, (Antonio) Portales, (Ziyad) Larkeche, (Scott) Fraser - they are coming back into the fold at the right time.'\n\"So as well as the team are doing at the moment, there is a real strengthening of the squad happening and what that gives me is real healthy competition.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy7gn6x2727o"}
