The left is doing that, burying its head in the sand time after time,'' he told the nrg news website.\nWhen asked if that meant a Palestinian state would not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu replied \"indeed\".\nAs incumbent prime minister it was Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to call these early elections with the aim of swapping a fractious right-wing coalition government for one which might be easier to manage.\nThere may still be enough like-minded parties in the next parliament to allow him to form a coalition but that is far from certain.\nEarly in the 90-day campaign his supporters worried he cut a complacent figure, declining a television debate with his rivals and stressing his national security credentials.\nIn recent days however he has shown a burst of energy but his rivals hope that is an indication of the anxiety his party managers are feeling.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31904962"}
