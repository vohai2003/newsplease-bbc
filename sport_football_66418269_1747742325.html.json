If they play well, we'll be successful as a team, and if we're successful as team then their value's only going to go up.\"\nIncluding pre-season matches, Whittaker has scored five goals in his last five Argyle games, having also netted in his last while on loan in January.\nMumba was a threat for much of the game against Huddersfield, playing in a more advanced role as Schumacher adopted a four-man defence for the first time under his leadership.\n\"We've seen how good they were last year, I believe that they've got the quality to step into this division and show their attributes and play with confidence,\" he added.\n\"I think once they get that backing from me and the coaching staff they go out and express themselves.\n\"Bali wasn't perfect today, but when he gets his moment and when he gets that one v one situation, he trusts himself to do something.\n\"They're two brilliant players, and they're only going to make our team better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66418269"}
