Sometimes we don't do anything, sometimes we do.\"\nAfter a stellar start to the campaign, Aberdeen are aiming to end an 11-game winless run at Ibrox on Wednesday.\nAnd Thelin dismissed the idea that there is no pressure on his side travelling to Govan, adding: \"The pressure is always there. You need some pressure to be better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2k50yzj74eo"}
