We could have been out of sight. Missed a penalty and created other good situations and a lot of chances. It's very even in the second half, it's not a half we should lose 2-0 but we did.\n\"It's the Premier League, it's the small bits that decide football matches. We deserved more. I will say that I'm a strong believer that if we play that game again then we would win it.\n\"You're too invested in it to stand and smile but inside you're burning. I hate losing. We can still finish eighth - that would be our highest in the Premier League. We have two players on 19 goals. So many positives. We need a little bit of help from Liverpool against Brighton.\n\"It's not the Gtech, it's the goal tech now!\n\"Everything is on. We will go into the last game of the season. Even if we finish top 10 then it is an unbelievable performance from this club and this team. We will do all we can to win at Wolves.\n\"Of course I am committed. We've just lost to Fulham, our local rivals. I am fuming.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crr7zwql9l8o"}
