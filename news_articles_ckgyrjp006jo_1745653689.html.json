It's not the first time it's happened.\"\nA spokesperson for Caredig, the housing association which looks after the Ty Derw complex, said: \"Since Friday, our contractors have identified the cause of the fault in the lift and replacement parts are on order, which we anticipate our engineers will be able to fit on 27 February.\n\"We apologise for any inconvenience as we take the health and wellbeing of tenants very seriously. As well as seeking to resolve the fault as quickly as possible, we have been in regular contact with those who live in Ty Derw.\n\"We have not been made aware of anyone who needs assistance to leave their flat, but we will, of course, endeavour to find a way of helping anyone who does, to do so safely.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgyrjp006jo"}
