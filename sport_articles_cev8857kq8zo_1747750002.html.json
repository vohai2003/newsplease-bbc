I didn’t think they opened us up too many times.\n“We were a wee bit loose in possession. It might take a wee bit of time for the players to believe in themselves and that was what let us down in the first half.\n“We didn’t have too many clear-cut chances within the game, but the task was to play a team of their calibre to see the level we’re at and what we need to aspire to.\n“We need to work in the final third at creating better opportunities, particularly against good teams when you get moments.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cev8857kq8zo"}
