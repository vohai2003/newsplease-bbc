Then you go to 2007 and you lose, 2011 and we lose and it's wow, this is way harder, we went 10 years without winning.\n\"So then with every one of these Super Bowl moments I get a chance to partake in, I'm going to exhaust every bit of energy I have into these games.\n\"Because when you lose this game, it's on your resume forever. A loss in the Super Bowl matters more than any loss you're ever going to be a part of.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cjr8gxw2qneo"}
