Number one is that Joao Gomes is brilliant. Number two, Andre is brilliant.\nAnd as a pair, they look unstoppable.\nLet's start with Joao. He was absolutely everywhere on Saturday, and while the game is not about how much you run, it is often about winning the ball back and distributing it wisely. That is exactly what Joao did time and time again.\nAs for Andre, a 93% passing accuracy stat is impressive considering that only Emmanuel Agbadou completed more passes than him. Not to mention Andre has a more creative role on the pitch.\nBoth of these players come from Brazil, both have the same agent and both are very, very good at football. If the second half on Saturday is anything to go by, 2025-26 could be a great season for Wolves.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gr9qd7951o"}
