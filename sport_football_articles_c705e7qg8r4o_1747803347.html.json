Who can possibly replace Kevin de Bruyne in a Manchester City shirt? The short answer is nobody. But you can get close in terms of importance to a team.\nThose in charge of such a mammoth task can simply cut no corners, both financially and in terms of personnel.\nFrom Manchester to you, Kevin: Thank you for everything!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c705e7qg8r4o"}
