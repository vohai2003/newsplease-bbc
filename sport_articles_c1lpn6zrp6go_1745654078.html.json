Not only is it Wimmer's first home game, a win will earn vital breathing space in the battle to beat the drop.\nThe gap between us and second-bottom Dundee has got uncomfortably short - just four points - and if things don't change fast it isn't looking good.\nSpeaking of things that aren't looking good, I wish Stuart Kettlewell would give up with the press tour.\nI felt genuine sympathy and anger on Kettlewell's behalf when the news first broke that abuse from fans is what made him leave the club, but there is too much inconsistency in his stories and I don't know what to believe any more.\nIt is hard to embrace the new era when there is so much negativity surrounding the club but we have to get behind the team and the manager on Wednesday and show we are so much more than the narrative being spun.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c1lpn6zrp6go"}
