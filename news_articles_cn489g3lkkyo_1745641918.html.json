They probably limped on towards the end to try desperately to keep it open and realising that they couldn't because there really wasn't anybody to use it any more,\" explains Ms Kuznecow.\nBy the end of the 19th Century, that same building reflected how the population of Spitalfields had changed again, becoming a synagogue to serve the growing Jewish population.\nWhile Jewish people had already been settling in the area, pogroms across Russia and neighbouring countries following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 saw more people arrive in an already-crowded part of town.\nMany of those found employment in the textile industry and of those who arrived in London, some 60% ended up working in the fashion industry.\nHints of the area's Jewish past can still be found near the homes once used by weavers.\nAlong Princelet Street, Ms Kuznecow points to a house which still has a detail on the door that would have been common in other properties locally.\n\"Every house in a Jewish town has a mezuzah, external on the door, which is like a little tube with a little Torah scroll inside and when you come through, you touch it.\"\nFurther down the road is a house with a peeling pink front, which was the childhood home of songwriter and Oliver! composer Lionel Bart, whose father was a tailor.\n\"His [Lionel's] name was Beglieter, and he took the name Bart from Bart's hospital. It would have obviously been a very Jewish area when he was growing up,\" says Ms Kuznecow.\nLike the Huguenots before them, over time Jewish people dispersed from the area, some of them to the richer suburbs of north London.\nThe synagogue they used to attend closed down in the 1970s and before long became the Brick Lane Mosque, also known as Brick Lane Jamme Masjid, reflecting the arrival of Bangladeshi immigrants.\nAs was the case with the Jewish incomers, Bengalis had already been settling in the area, but political upheaval at home from the middle of the 20th Century saw a significant increase in the number of people arriving.\n\"They carried on the textile stuff the Jewish people were in a lot,\" says Ms Kuznecow, \"and of course they did a lot of restaurants and cooking\".\nBrick Lane now boasts numerous Bengali grocers and textile stores - as well as the curry houses the street is today best known for.\nIn the 2021 census, 20.7% of London's overall population of 8.8 million people described themselves as Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh - while in the Spitalfields and Banglatown ward, external 51.8% were recorded as Asian, Asian British and Asian Welsh.\nThis sentiment is echoed by Panikos Panayi, professor of European history at De Montfort University. He says that Spitalfields, like other parts of London, has seen constant demographic change over the centuries.\nProf Panayi, author of Migrant City: A New History of London, explains that before the middle of the 20th Century the most common places from which people came to London were within the British Isles, and from central and Eastern Europe.\n\"After the Second World War is when it becomes increasingly diverse,\" he explains, with the likes of the Windrush generation also arriving - while the expansion of the EU in 2004 had its own impact on London's demographics.\n\"It's in 21st Century where we can probably use the phrase 'superdiverse',\" he says.\nProf Panayi believes London's place on the world stage means it will continue to be a \"migrant city\".\n\"London is still a phenomenally important city in the global economy so it will attract migration... it'll just come from different parts of the world from what it did before we left the EU in 2021.\"\nBack in Redchurch Street, two buildings that were once homes and workplaces for French and Jewish immigrants - and had until recently been on the verge of disintegration - are set to take a new place in Spitalfields' textiles tradition.\nHaving been purchased by the Truman Brewery estate, run by the Zeloof family who made their wealth through the clothing industry, they have undergone a Â£2m restoration project and are set to become the first UK base for Canadian-Egyptian sustainable fashion firm KOTN.\nOut on the street, Chris Dyson points to the growing number of high-end clothing shops springing up around the area.\nFor all that things have changed over time, Spitalfields' centuries-old association with textiles endures, he says.\n\"They're still keeping the area's connection with fashion.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn489g3lkkyo"}
