He is developing into a man and I know that there is still plenty more to come from him.\n\"He was magnificent in our FA Cup match against Derby County earlier this month and the challenge for him now is to produce that kind of performance on a more consistent basis.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly4dp7y0vdo"}
