It's a fantastic hit and a goal well worthy of winning a derby. It's something that will live with him for the rest of his life. It needed to be a really good strike because Craig Gordon's a top goalkeeper. A special moment for a special game.\n\"The players need to enjoy these moments and the scenes after the game, the connection that's building all the time. We need to keep moving forwards but it's certainly one for the fans.\n\"We need to cement a place in the top six. There's not going to be a game between now and the split where there's nothing on it. The quicker we can cement our place in the top six, the more points we can pick up, gives us a real chance to then start moving forwards.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cvg1748lve5o"}
