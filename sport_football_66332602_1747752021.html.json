It's fantastic for him,\" said Talbot.\nTalbot's side took on Sheffield United - then in the second tier - in the following season's competition, with the first match at Nene Park and a replay at Bramall Lane both ending as 1-1 draws before the Blades prevailed 6-5 on penalties.\n\"All credit to the players who got us to those ties,\" Talbot recalled. \"We should have beaten Leeds at Nene Park, they'd had a player (Jonathan Woodgate) sent off, we got a corner and we missed a good chance in the last five minutes. Obviously we lost away but they were great nights for the club.\"\nDiamonds won promotion from the Conference in 2001 and after losing out in the Division Three - now League Two - play-offs 12 months later, they went up as champions in 2003 with 87 points from their 46 games.\nTheir spell in Division Two only lasted one season, and Talbot - a member of Ipswich's 1978 FA Cup-winning team - left in March 2004 to take over at Oldham Athletic.\n\"I loved every minute of it and it's a shame it had to end, but that's what happens in football sometimes. Finances got tough and we had to move on, but I thank Mr Griggs and the board of directors for inviting me there and (they) developed a super club,\" he said.\n\"He was a fantastic man, a generous man, he was always very positive, supportive and for the local community it was magnificent what he achieved.\"\nFollowing the collapse of the original club, the new Diamonds began playing in the summer of 2012 and won the United Counties League Premier Division title three years later.\nNext season, though, they will be at step four of the non-league pyramid, playing in Northern Premier League Midlands Division.\n\"Times are hard for all business. Football's no different, and we needed to find some creative ways for the club,\" said current chairman Rob Usher.\n\"This legends day is the centrepiece of 'Save Our Summer', it's the big show. We don't want to go cap in hand to people, we don't just want people to give us money, we want to give them something in return.\n\"We hope Sunday is going to reward everybody who has been a part of the history of Rushden & Diamonds, throughout both clubs.\"\nTalbot also hopes the match will help ease the financial pressures on the club going forwards.\n\"They always had a good fan base,\" he added.\n\"They've moved to a new ground now but (I hope) people can keep it going, because it brings people together, it brings happiness and football clubs in local towns and villages are a big base for everybody.\"\nBrian Talbot was speaking to BBC Radio Northampton's Graham McKechnie and Annabel Amos.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66332602"}
