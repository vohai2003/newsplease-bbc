Retaining that model is also an option.\nOne of the major issues with any reconstruction would be how the financial distribution model would work.\nLast year the SPFL announced record turnover of £44m with more than £33m being awarded to the clubs.\nTop-flight clubs were given more than £27.5m of that total with the rest being split between the Championship and Leagues 1 and 2.\nIn addition to this income, Premiership clubs who do not feature in the group or league stages of European football currently share 'solidarity payments' from Uefa, which are distributed by the Scottish FA.\nLast season these payments were in excess of £600,000 with this current season's total expected to be around the £900,000.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62x56lvl55o"}
