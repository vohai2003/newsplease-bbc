Only Elliot Watt had more touches than Ross Sinclair in goal, or Sven Sprangler, Barry Douglas or Mikulic in defence.\nFor large spells, they spent more time on the ball but they were always under pressure. It was like St Mirren were setting traps, and St Johnstone were tip-toeing dangerously close to them.\nAt times, they relied on the hosts' mercy in front of goal and had to absorb a lot of pressure. But Sinclair, back in goals for the first time since September, did well deputising in the sticks.\nThe team still looks a little patched together - the back three includes a left-back and a central midfielder - but they seem to have gelled quickly and Sprangler, who has worn the armband for the past few games, has taken to the role well.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cj65w8nepdlo"}
