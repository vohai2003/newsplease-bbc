Increasing their numbers inside the penalty area means that the crosser has a number of options and contact is bound to be made by one of the players attacking.\nOne of the wingers will move inward and join the attacking line, and one of the two midfielders in Brighton's 4-2-3-1 formation will also push up to provide support in the box. Their match-winner against Manchester City earlier this season was one such example, where Matt O'Riley burst past Rico Lewis into the City box to score.\nBrighton's underlying data from last campaign under De Zerbi suggested their style of play was most similar to Pep Guardiola's City - but Hurzeler's approach has taken them away from that, with more directness introduced in possession.\nThe average Brighton possession sequence is about 3.5 passes, making them one of the more dynamic sides in the Premier League.\nWhereas under De Zerbi they possessed the ball a lot more in their own third to bait the opposition press, Brighton are now happy to play long balls when necessary to reach the final third, win second balls and then move the ball centrally or funnel it wide for cutback opportunities or crosses.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70e0enlepxo"}
