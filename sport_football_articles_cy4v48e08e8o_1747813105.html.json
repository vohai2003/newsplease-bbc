He had previously been out of with a calf problem.\nMaguire has been absent with a calf problem since the FA Cup defeat by Fulham on 2 March.\nYoro had to be replaced at half-time in the Premier League draw with Arsenal on 9 March.\nNeither midfielder Kobbie Mainoo nor defender Ayden Heaven were shown in the section of training that was filmed on United's social media feed on Friday morning.\nMainoo has been missing since the beginning of February because of injury, while Heaven was pictured this week still wearing a protective boot following the injury that led to him being taken off on a stretcher at Leicester on 16 March.\nGoalkeeping duo Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton were also pictured training, which should mean there is experienced cover for Andre Onana at the City Ground.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy4v48e08e8o"}
