I say that because if the Philadelphia Eagles want to win this game, they've got to put pressure on Patrick Mahomes.\n\"They've got to make him worry in the pocket, they've got to make him fear that he shouldn't step up because he's going to get sacked.\n\"They've got to frustrate him, and that's going to be all up to the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line, and I think that could be the possible difference maker if the Eagles want to win. But I think the Chiefs will win 30-26.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvg8dge8rp1o"}
