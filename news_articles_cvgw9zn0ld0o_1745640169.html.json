We don't have any public toilets, so you have to go to Saughton Park or Princes Street.\n\"But in the area, we do have Gorgie Farm, we have an Edinburgh Leisure pool, where people could use those â€“ but Edinburgh Leisure's policy is that you can't use their toilets if you're not a member.\n\"We're trying to make sure that any council building that's appropriate with public toilets has a default right of access.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgw9zn0ld0o"}
