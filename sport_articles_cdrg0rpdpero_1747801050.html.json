The way we started the game was huge, the composure we showed and getting the goal.\n\"You put a game plan in place knowing Rangers are going to have a lot of the ball, so you have to be really disciplined without the ball. Every time there was a slight mistake, a teammate was there to bail them out. A massive collective performance - the subs came on and impacted the game.\n\"It's an incredible run and the players deserve all the credit for it. The big thing was trusting what we were doing. Not being too high when it's good and not being too low when it wasn't.\n\"I never stopped believing and it's been a huge collective effort from everyone involved.\n\"If we keep winning games, nobody can catch us and that's the mindset moving forwards.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdrg0rpdpero"}
