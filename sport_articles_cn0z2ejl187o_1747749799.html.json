You saw last season when he probably was available Luke Shaw went in most of the time, even with [Victor] Lindelof and they did a very good job.\n\"The right thing that should happen really is Maguire should probably leave, just for his own sake and his England career really. He took a lot of abuse from a lot of the quarters of the fan base and it's unfortunate, but it's just a sign of the times really of what's happened.\n\"His £80m price tag was never his real value and he's constantly being judged against that, which is no fault of his own.\n\"He is a very good Premier League defender. I think the occasion has just got to him, but if he was to stay at United this season I don't think he would get a lot of games.\n\"I do feel for the guy, but it is time to move on unfortunately.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn0z2ejl187o"}
