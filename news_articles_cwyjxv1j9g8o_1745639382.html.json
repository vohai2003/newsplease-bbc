The evidence of those attacks was videos shown to the jury that Zou kept of him having sex with unconscious and semi-conscious women. Police have never identified them.\nFour of the rapes took place in London. Two women were identified and gave evidence; the other two rapes were of the same woman, but she has never been tracked down.\nJurors had to watch footage of nine of the rapes during court proceedings, appearing visibly upset and being given regular breaks as the material was shown.\nSome of the attacks were filmed at his flats in Bloomsbury and Elephant and Castle, others at an unknown location in China.\nThe prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.\nIn his defence, Zou told the jury he had discussed sexual preferences with one of the women he filmed, and she had said she liked \"uniform role play\".\n\"We specifically discussed the kinds of role play I like, which was rape role play,\" he said. He told the court this was how the videos came to be made.\nThe Met Police has launched an appeal to find any other victims.\n\"If you're a woman who's in any way had a one-on-one encounter with this man Zou, then we would like to hear from you,\" Cdr Southworth said.\nThe force said it was particularly keen to hear from women from the Chinese student community who may have met Zou and were living in and around London between 2019 and 2024.\nThe Met said it would also like to speak to potential victims who may have met Zou while he was living in China. Reports to the force can be made online via the Major Incident Public Portal, external.\nSaira Pike from the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to the courageous women who came forward to report Zhenhao Zou's heinous crimes.\n\"They have been incredibly strong and brave â€“ there is no doubt that their evidence helped us to secure today's verdict.\n\"Zou is a serial rapist and a danger to women.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyjxv1j9g8o"}
