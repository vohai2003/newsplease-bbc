This is a great opportunity for me to come back and do it again.\"\nManager Stuart Kettlewell added: \"I'm really pleased to welcome Ellery to the club.\n\"We've not had our issues to seek with regards to injuries within the goalkeeping department. Ellery has played plenty of football this season in this league, so he won't need a settling-in period.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4gxezl8ykxo"}
