He's already training at night and the weekend.\n\"And how will the school fill his day when he's dropped 10 hours off his timetable and he's not studied some of these subjects for over two years?\"\nCharlie said it would feel like the school was \"abandoning\" him if it closed.\n\"The school has produced quite good athletes and it's the only one in Scotland,\" he said.\n\"It would be quite stupid to close it down. I think it would affect good junior athletes in the country.\n\"It's in my head that I might not have this next year and it could affect me in my future.\"\nA freeze on new pupils was introduced in 2024, due to the city council and Glasgow Life seeking funding support for the school.\nCouncil papers, external state that although 62% of the school's pupils come from outside Glasgow, \"both the Scottish government and local authorities indicated they were not able to provide financial support\".\nAs a result, the report found \"this equates to Glasgow spending circa Â£380k on the education of non-Glasgow pupils each school session\".\nMs Junnor, who lives in Renfrewshire, fears a new bursary scheme will only apply to Glasgow-based pupils.\nShe added: \"It seems to be a postcode lottery which is a real shame because these kids don't play for their local council, they play for Scotland.\n\"It seems like if you're not from the Glasgow area, you can attend the school but you're on your own. There's no coaching, no physio, no anything.\"\nShe also said it was \"ignorant\" to suggest Badminton Scotland could take on the cost of funding a similar programme.\nClare Martin, whose son Alfie also plays badminton at the school, said parents were told that the school was examining the effectiveness of the school's structure last year.\n\"But they held all the information back about how serious it was,\" she said. \"And nobody ever mentioned that it would be getting closed.\"\nShe said such a move would be \"devastating\" for Alfie, who has been tipped as a future Commonwealth or Olympian athlete.\n\"Glasgow Council has decided to host the next Commonwealth Games and they're wanting to shut the School of Sport down in the same year,\" she added. \"It's not a good look.\"\nShe said parents had written to the school but so far they had heard nothing back.\n\"It would mean Alfie might need to move to a school in East Kilbride that he's never been to,\" she added. \"He's worried about his future.\n\"Everybody is very angry that we haven't been given the full information and we're unsure about what's going to happen next.\"\nFormer pupils at the school include swimmer Michael Jamieson, an Olympic and Commonwealth Games silver medallist, and badminton player Kirsty Gilmour.\nMs Gilmour said the school gave her \"the perfect balance of getting my education while really having that focus on sport\".\n\"Being able to do sport and school at the same time was so good,\" she said.\n\"And the fact it was free and just a normal public school was so valuable.\n\"It's really sad that kids aren't going to get that same opportunity. I hope there's something that can happen to boost them.\n\"It was absolutely crucial for me and I don't know if I would have stood in as good stead going into senior badminton without the School of Sport.\"\nA Glasgow Life spokesperson said: \"The current School of Sport model was introduced more than 25 years ago and was designed to meet the needs of pupils from across Scotland at the time.\n\"Since then, national funding for governing bodies of sport has improved the support they offer prospective athletes considerably, offering multiple pathways to elite sports competition.\n\"In considering whether Glasgow School of Sport offers the appropriate model in the wider national context, we have also proposed a new way to support young athletes from Glasgow to achieve their full potential.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyn924d9gro"}
