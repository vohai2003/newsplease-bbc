Ipswich were not in the Premier League as tourists but there was little pressure after their rapid rise.\nThe money they spent - a reported Â£150m - should have made them more competitive after just one home win all season but it shows the gulf between the Premier League and Championship, let alone for a team who were in League One two years ago.\nThere will be pride in their journey but their spell among English football's elite is about to come to an end.\nThe smiles at the end said it all. In contrast to his counterpart McKenna, Wolves boss Vitor Pereira beamed and high-fived his staff in the stands as his side maintained their impressive winning run.\nThe Portuguese was banned from the touchline after his third yellow card of the season against West Ham in midweek, but it was a small price to pay for the man who had plotted their mission to survive.\nPereira arrived in December after Wolves had lost 2-1 at home to Ipswich, leaving them four points from safety and desperately in need of a lift.\nThey now have a 12-point gap to the bottom three thanks to a spirited comeback success.\nWolves kept their composure after going behind in the first half and took control in the second period. After beating Southampton and West Ham, this was a third straight win for the first time this season and first since December 2023.\n\"We are staying up\" chanted the away fans as they saluted Pereira and his team, who have shown a relish for battle and their survival instincts.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c230kmx9828t"}
