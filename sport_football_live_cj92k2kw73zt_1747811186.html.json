I'm more disappointed in our reaction after going 1-0 down.\n\"The goal was an action we can avoid, but it took us more than 30 minutes to react and start to build up the pitch and put them under pressure.\n\"We lost a little bit of our identity in these moments. I'm disappointed because I expect my team to come back quicker and put the opposition on the back foot and under pressure a bit more.\"\nLuton Town manager Matt Bloomfield told BBC Three Counties Radio:\n\"We've got to be incredibly proud of the performance today. We started well, hit the post and had a couple of good chances.\n\"Being the away side, there's a time when you're going to have to defend and we did that.\n\"The goal was obviously extremely fortunate but in terms of our performance, the endeavour, the way the boys are playing, the shape, there's a lot to be pleased and proud about.\n\"The fans want to see our boys' grit and determination. That's what our club stands for and they saw that today.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cj92k2kw73zt"}
