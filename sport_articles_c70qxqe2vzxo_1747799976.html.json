Go there and get points and play our game. At the end of the day, whatever happens, as long as we play our game, we'll be happy and it's up to us.\n\"We have the mindset, we have the personnel, we have the camaraderie and we have the chemistry, so you create your own luck and it's really up to us.\n\"I don't really feel any pressure come off. I think you approach every game the same way and I haven't got that vibe from anybody, the coaching staff or players, that you settle down.\n\"I think it's just really the Celtic way to approach every game the same way and that's why you see results.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c70qxqe2vzxo"}
