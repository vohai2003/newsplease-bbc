The past two seasons were about staying up, keeping our head above water, and we have got that momentum at the minute.\"\nOn goalscorer Anthony Elanga: \"He is a dream for a midfielder. Especially us sitting in that low-block - you can give him the ball and he does the rest.\"\nOn possibly qualifying for Champions League: \"I don't want to say as football is so cruel. We have got the cup to focus on and we have got the league.\n\"We are at Villa Park [on] Saturday and they're flying. We take each game as it comes.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c33zvkpdj00o"}
