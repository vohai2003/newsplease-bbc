He is tactically smart so he can be valuable anywhere.\n\"We need more than one player there. We need different styles, different types of players who can help us in the three positions we use in the midfield.\n\"The club is trying to sign the players, but we have to wait for the right situation.\n\"We all think it's better to wait a little bit more for the correct player - the player who suits your style and is better for the club.\"\nIraola confirmed Billing's injury is not serious and the Dutchman could be available when Bournemouth host Lorient in their final pre-season game on 5 August (17:00 BST kick-off).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3gd0dyde94o"}
