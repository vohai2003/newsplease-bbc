Such a document usually includes confirmation a player wishes to breach the terms of their employment, the reasons behind the request, and the player's signature.\nBut transfer requests can also take other forms. For example, a player or somebody acting on their behalf may inform a manager at a training ground, could give an interview to the press in which they make their desire to move clear, or might post on social media to make sure the wider football community is fully aware of what they want.\nA club is under no obligation to accept any transfer request.\nIn theory, a transfer request from a player could force their club's hand - if it becomes public knowledge a player wants to leave, then the club's hand is potentially weakened in transfer negotiations.\nIf a player becomes aware that a new team is interested in signing them, but negotiations with their club are proving difficult, they may deem a transfer request necessary to try to hurry the process along.\nIn some instances, a player may submit a transfer request not out of desire to join a specific new club, but because of a dispute of some sort at their current one. That means a transfer request can inform potential suitors the player is available, draw out interest and encourage teams to make an offer to the player's club.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77jgrj20ylo"}
