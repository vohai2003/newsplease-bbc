It's the first time in a long time I've done that.\"\nJohnson retains the top spot despite struggling to find the form that resulted in three victories heading into the Masters in April, when he was forced to pull out after slipping and injuring his back on the eve of the tournament.\n\"Today was the first time it's kind of felt - the golf swing - I was in control, like I was leading into the Masters,\" he added.\nJustin Rose finished the day on two under par, while fellow Englishman Paul Casey and Martin Laird of Scotland are a stroke further back.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/41046709"}
