It wasn't helped by Sam Allison's refereeing.\nJohn Mousinho described the first half showing as \"dreadful\" and it's hard to disagree. Nothing went right for Pompey and their deliveries into the box were especially poor.\nThey fought back in the second half and Connor Ogilvie will be rueing his late miss.\nIt's an opportunity squandered for Pompey as a win would have made it extremely tough for Luton to have caught them. That being said their survival bid remains in good shape.\nRegan Poole and Marlon Pack did okay as centre-backs but Hayden Matthews and Rob Atkinson will be missed.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cqly67k1501o"}
