But the Hibs boss feels his team are heading to Tannadice \"in a much better place than we were previously\".\nHe wouldn't be drawn on Jamie McGrath's pre-contract and insists \"he's still an Aberdeen player\" but does admit he was \"delighted\" to get the deal done.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c07zkzxe9p2o"}
