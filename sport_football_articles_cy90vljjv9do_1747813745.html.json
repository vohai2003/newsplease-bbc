We need to make sure that chasing a dream doesn't get blurry and make sure we chase the dream with positivity and enthusiasm for next season.\n\"We have to start creating our own history here in this stadium and we started this season. There is much more to come and it won't be easy. These players have the talent.\n\"We need to rest and finish at Southampton and then go on holiday. Any other club in this position would finish in a position that we cannot even dream of.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy90vljjv9do"}
