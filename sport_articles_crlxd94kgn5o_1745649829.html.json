A really important three points, and another three points toward where we want to get to - 35 points. That was our total last season. We've now got nine games to really add to that.\n\"It was a tough game, we had to defend a lot. They put us under a lot of pressure, a lot of entries into our box. It's definitely not the best we've played this season, but it's the best three points we've had this season.\n\"They had a few openings which on another day they take. Derek [McInnes] will be disappointed they didn't take one of the chances. I've got to focus on my own group. I see a team that's putting their body on the line.\n\"That's three wins in the last four games at an important stage of the season. I couldn't ask for any more in terms of the effort they're putting in.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/crlxd94kgn5o"}
