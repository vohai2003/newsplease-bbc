They have a tiny chance as it is, but if we lose the first game back off the international break, a narrative will form - especially given how dreadful we were in the Carabao Cup final.\nIn truth, Liverpool needed the mental breather that the international break provided, and the fact we were not in the FA Cup at the weekend was a blessing, too.\nThe players ran out of legs against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League and had nothing for the Wembley final with Newcastle a few days later.\nThey have been back in training for a few days and Arne Slot will be keen to get revenge on Everton for what happened at Goodison Park in February.\nA furious Slot confronted referee Michael Oliver at full-time, earning himself a two-game ban in the process.\nBut if Liverpool fail to beat Everton for the second time this season, the blame can only lie internally. It is time to end Arsenal's hopes for good.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn80l71j14jo"}
