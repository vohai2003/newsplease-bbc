Obviously it doesn't make you feel good that some items have been stolen.\"\nInvestigators said the value of the stolen artworks was unknown, but they \"have sentimental value to the church and its members\".\nMr Harwood said he believed the thieves had secured a door from inside the church during the day and entered through it later. There was no damage to the building.\nHe added they would be more \"vigilant and more aware\" but would still keep their doors open to members of the public.\nThe force is appealing for anyone with information about the incident to get in touch.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn9vv54wz8xo"}
