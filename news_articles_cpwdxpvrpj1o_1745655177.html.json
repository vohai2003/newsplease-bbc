Nothing would heal\".\n\"We spent a long time back and forth to the vets until eventually she was in so much pain,\" she said.\n\"She'd cry, yelpâ€¦ as soon as she made a fuss there'd be blood everywhere.\n\"The vet came to the conclusion that the best thing we could do for her welfare and quality of life would be to take the tail away.\"\nThat was when Gwen was two. Within a year she was taking top ribbons at dog shows in Wales, making the Welsh team set to compete at Crufts in Birmingham in March.\nBut then Ms Scott-Thomas got a call from the show saying Gwen could not compete because her tail was docked.\nShe argued that Gwen's tail was not docked, but legally amputated by a veterinarian.\nShe said she was told there are no exceptions under rules set out by Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nShe has since started a petition, external asking for an exemption that would allow dogs like Gwen, whose tails have been amputated for medical reasons, to compete.\n\"They should be assessed as an individual rather than a blanket ban, which it is at the moment,\" she said.\nThe Kennel Club said: \"We are aware of this situation, but in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act 2006, a dog with a medically docked tail cannot be shown at events in England and Wales where the public pay admission fees.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwdxpvrpj1o"}
