When you take yourself away from the bubble, you think about how lucky you was.\n\"That's no disrespect to any of the other clubs I played for, but the seven years we had there, I don't think it will happen again in football.\"\nWalker was part of all six Premier League title wins at City under Pep Guardiola, having joined the club from Tottenham in 2017 in a Â£50m deal.\nThe 34-year-old was named City's joint-captain in 2023 as part of a five-player leadership group elected by his team-mates before the 2023-24 season.\n\"I said to the player liaison officer that I wanted to say goodbye to the lads in the canteen before I left when I knew the deal was complete,\" he said. \"He actually texted the whole building. There was 150 people there and I had to say goodbye to them, which was a little bit nerve-wracking.\n\"It was sad because, as much as people might have this persona of me, I did speak to completely everyone in that building from the cleaners to the cooks, to the kitmen to physios.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1wdjy3q419o"}
