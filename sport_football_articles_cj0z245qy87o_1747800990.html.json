We had two or three opportunities before they scored which we should probably take.\n\"There was an opportunity to gain three points but well done to Gary [Rowett], they deserve their win and obviously an amazing away record comes to an end.\n\"It's not an attitude problem, we just made some bad decisions. It was a slow pitch, a dry day, and we have to recognise we have to play a little bit quicker and more direct.\n\"We've got to make better decisions, to do something different. We didn't do the basics right.\n\"The game's not won on a coupon, the game's won on a pitch, and we didn't do enough to win.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj0z245qy87o"}
