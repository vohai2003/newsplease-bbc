It's very difficult to come in during the season and have no pre-season, but he has to look to the future and moving forward.\nHe says the goal is winning the Premier League, but how can they compete? I think the next step for them is to get further up the table.\nManagers aren't getting that time over the last 10 to 15 years. You have to be selfish as a manager and say: 'Okay, if I don't do it now I might not get that time'.\nI think it's a little naive to say they are looking to win the Premier League because, from where they are now, they are a long way off that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cdrx5gv431po"}
