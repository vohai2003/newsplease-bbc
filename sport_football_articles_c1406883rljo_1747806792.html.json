We said before the game that if we could win today, we would be fourth in the league. We did our job, now let's support Crystal Palace for their game today against Chelsea. I'm very happy for everyone.\n\"I think we are in a very good rotation right now and we are in a very good moment. I was happy with the result.\n\"I think after a team gets a goal in the beginning, it is always important for us to score after two or three minutes so that it is in a key moment of the game. The first goal gave us the confidence back.\n\"We could have avoided the opening goal, but no problem because we turned things around. But, if we don't concede first [in the future] then all is good!\"\nOn teammate Alexander Isak: \"He is for me, nowadays, the best striker in the world. No one has performed better than him. I'm pleased for him, he is a very good guy and a very good player. I hope he can keep scoring and helping us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1406883rljo"}
