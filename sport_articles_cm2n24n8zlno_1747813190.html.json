Hearts have lost 25 of their last 27 visits in all competitions.\nBut, under Steven Naismith, Hearts did enjoy a 2-0 away win over the champions last season and Rangers have shown Rodgers' men can be beaten in their own backyard.\nShould Neil Critchley's team come away empty handed, it could have big ramifications. Hearts are sixth, a point above Motherwell, four points in front of St Mirren and Ross County and two points below Dundee United.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cm2n24n8zlno"}
