Three straight home draws had seen Villa lose ground on the top spots, making the victory even more crucial.\nThe relief and celebrations that greeted Marco Asensio's winner certainly acknowledged that Villa's league campaign still had a pulse in terms of qualifying for Europe again. They will know they need to replicate the result when top-half rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest visit Villa Park in the coming months.\nUpcoming trips to Crystal Palace and Brentford give Villa a realistic chance of improving that Opta percentage, especially with the knowledge that key players like Pau Torres, Boubacar Kamara, Ross Barkley, and Amadou Onana should be back to reinforce the squad by the time they return from the March international break to see out the remainder of the season.\nOf course, Villa have the last-16 round of both the FA Cup and Champions League in the next week to distract them, and this is where any potential league resurgence will be truly tested.\nMaintaining performance levels in such a short period of time after two very promising displays against Liverpool and Chelsea will be difficult, particularly at Palace. But the next fortnight is key.\nFollow-up the Chelsea win with another three points at Selhurst Park, then take care of business against Club Brugge in the Champions League and Cardiff in the FA Cup, and the final two months of the season could offer up real opportunity.\nHopefully, by then, even Opta will acknowledge that Villa's percentage chance of success will be well above 7% across all three fronts.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c30mn274pejo"}
