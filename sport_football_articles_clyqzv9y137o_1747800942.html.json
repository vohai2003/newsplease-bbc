I think it's going to hurt for the next few days but we have had a lot of setbacks this season which have usually been followed by good responses.\n\"I think we have to let this one hurt for a good few days but also get back to work on the training pitch and really work hard. We need to go back to the things we were doing really well.\n\"We have to show a response next Saturday and hopefully show a good response there.\n\"We had chances. They took their two opportunities really, which were low blows for us. We responded really well to the first one and got the equaliser, but I think in the second half we lacked a bit of cutting edge.\n\"The goalkeeper made a few good saves but I think we could've done more to test him.\n\"I think there's going to be a few regrets from this game but luckily in football there is another game that is going to come quickly. It's our job now to respond well.\"\nOn there being lots to play for still: \"I think this is just going to motivate us more now. I think everyone will be raring to go against Leicester next Saturday, so we've got to show a response.\n\"It's hurt us and hurt our fans.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyqzv9y137o"}
