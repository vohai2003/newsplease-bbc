They beat the likes of Bayern Munich, they travel away to certain places and have looked good as well. They look like they belong there,\" Onuoha said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"But then you go to a place like Monaco and don't really give the performance that you want to.\n\"Losing that game is a bit troubling as you head towards the knockouts.\n\"Maybe it will be a lesson. I don't think Unai Emery, as somebody who is so experienced, will overreact. Hopefully the players they keep their confidence up as well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c17errek1e9o"}
