It's just bizarre. I can only think it is concentration.\n\"I think he's just got no credit in the bank now. He doesn't have the crowd on his side.\"\nBBC Radio Leeds' Leeds reporter Adam Pope: \"I think it's inexplicable. He was under no pressure. You can't defend it anymore.\n\"Maybe Farke sits down with (captain) Ethan Ampadu and asks him if the lads still trust Illan or if they want a change? The way it's going this could ruin Leeds' chances of automatic promotion.\"\nFormer Leeds player Aidy White on BBC Radio Leeds: \"It's one too many now. You can be forgiven for maybe one or two but the amount of games it has happened nowâ€¦ a huge decision has got to be made with seven games left.\n\"I think you've got to drop him now. Farke came out and supported him last time but how long can you keep trusting him for?\"\nIf Leeds are to make a change between the sticks then it is likely to be veteran Karl Darlow who is given the gloves.\nThe 34-year-old has made just two league appearances since joining from Newcastle in the summer of 2023, once as a sub after Meslier was sent off at Preston on 26 December that year and then in the 1-0 reverse at West Brom three days later when the number one was suspended.\nUnlike most number twos, Darlow has seen some action this season as he is first choice for Wales, where he plays alongside club team-mates Rodon, Ampadu and Dan James, so he would not be coming in cold if he were to be given a chance at relegation-threatened Luton on Saturday.\nHe also has experience of winning promotion from this division, having made 34 appearances as the Magpies won the Championship title in 2016-17.\nFarke refused to blame Meslier for Saturday's result and you feel that whatever decision he makes now, all eyes will be on whoever is between the posts for Leeds at Kenilworth Road this weekend.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crkxd87y62ko"}
