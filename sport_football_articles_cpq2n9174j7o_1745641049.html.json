We have so many hopes and in the FA Cup we want to go as far as we can. On penalties, the emotions are always high.\n\"We proceed in our journey together. We are delighted for them. It's a good moment and it's important for the club to give it a real go. Now we have to focus on the Premier League but the FA Cup is always going to be on our mind.\"\nOn it going to penalties: \"In every FA Cup draw we have to practise penalties and we kept the same order as Exeter. We did really well and they were good penalties.\n\"I believe it makes part of the game preparations, the same time as the goalkeeper is to practise and get as much info as possible. It's dedication.\n\"It's not nice at all - anxiety, nervous, mix or emotions. I try not to watch and just wait for the noise!\n\"It was huge for us [Matz Sels' save]. The players did their jobs well, they were good penalties and Matz [Sels] - amazing for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cpq2n9174j7o"}
