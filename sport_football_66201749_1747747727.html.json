There's never an easy game, just like there isn't one in League One or League Two.\nAshby has yet to feature for Newcastle since they bought him from West Ham for Â£3m in January.\nThe 21-year-old scored the winning goal as Newcastle beat Rangers 2-1 in Allan McGregor's testimonial at Ibrox last week.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66201749"}
