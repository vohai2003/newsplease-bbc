The first half was not good enough from us, and we know that. We tried in the second half to correct that and fight more for the first and second balls.\n\"Unfortunately, we couldn't score and then they scored in the worst moment game because I think it was more like a draw.\n\"Obviously in the Premier League, you have to compete and it is very hard to take that small moments can make the difference. We are going to learn and fight. Hopefully we can bounce back.\"\nOn their lack of goals this season: \"Goals give you wins and, at the moment, we can't find a way to score goals. That's a fact. We cannot hide from that.\n\"We have to work and need to find a way to score goals. We need to score to win games and at the moment it's difficult.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr4rv4wqk1ko"}
