She was remanded in custody until her sentencing on 25 April.\nPaying tribute to Alexander, his family previously described him as a \"very kind child\" who was always well behaved and \"never naughty\".\n\"He loved playing with his little sister and playing with his dog, Daisy,\" they added.\n\"He was amazing [and] always helpful. Always eager to assist with cooking and cleaning.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lpdm4qmvno"}
