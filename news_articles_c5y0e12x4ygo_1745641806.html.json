You could just tiptoe past them,\" he said.\nTheir claims related to two wards at the hospital - Wrekin and Clent.\nMr Vincent said staff were often too scared to raise concerns with managers, including concerns for their safety.\nThe Black Country Healthcare trust had already been told to improve its mental health inpatient services after safeguarding issues were raised following an inspection in February 2023.\nMany of the issues highlighted at the time - lack of individual care, staff not having skills required and patients being discharged too soon - have also been been raised since by Mr Vincent.\nThe trust has also been subject to a vote of no confidence by consultants and a poor staff survey last year.\nIn a letter to staff, Chief Executive Marsha Foster identified areas where this year's staff survey also gave cause for concern, which were trust values and behaviours, accountability, leadership compassion and inclusion, managers' effectiveness and freedom to speak up.\n\"I know we need to do better,\" she wrote. \"These latest results make that even clearer.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y0e12x4ygo"}
