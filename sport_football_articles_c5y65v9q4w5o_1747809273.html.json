But, on a tough pitch, it was a fairly even first half.\n\"We spoke about our mindset at half-time; to play forward, run forward, and we scored a fantastic goal, and then got hit by a sucker-punch.\n\"But I thought we responded terrifically. There was some outstanding stuff from us on a tough pitch. I really enjoyed our second half.\n\"We wanted to grab an opportunity and take it to the opposition. Not many teams will dominate like we did in the second half and we could have nearly nicked it at the end.\n\"Ultimately, we've come away, we've taken a point and come away with something.\n\"I thought we became more dominant as the game wore on. We took the legs out of them. There are lots of positives to take, but things we can also work on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y65v9q4w5o"}
