We had chances, but they have very good centre-backs and goalkeeper, and we couldn't make the difference until close to the end.\n\"Probably we should have scored earlier but, fortunately, this time it hasn't cost us points.\n\"We wanted to open the game as much as possible but this is tough against Everton. Once they started running out of legs, they can evenly attack you so we can exploit more spaces.\n\"That didn't happen until the end and we needed a very good finish with a lovely goal from David Brooks. He has top quality, with the striking and composure, so I am happy for him.\n\"We are happy with the run of games, the results and the performances. I think we now play four of the next five against top five teams, who are ahead of us, so I hope we can continue with this level of performance.\n\"I don't know if it is enough to beat these teams, but we will try to be competitive with the teams at the top.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cq8qjjywk10o"}
