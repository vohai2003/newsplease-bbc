Corey Blackett-Taylor found space on the left to cross the ball in low for Dobson to finish.\nOrient struggled for a breakthrough in the second half, although Tom James saw his effort after 57 minutes deflected over the crossbar.\nTyreece Campbell just failed to control the ball enough to round Brynn after 72 minutes, while May saw his shot four minutes later flash over the bar.\nSubstitute Panutche Camara missed a sitter in stoppage time to double the Charlton lead, but the hosts held on for the narrow victory.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66345524"}
