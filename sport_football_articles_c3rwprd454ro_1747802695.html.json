I've said before, when you look back on a season, there's maybe 10 to 12 games where you're at it and on top and there's loads of games in between and some where you're not.\n\"Maybe the coaches and managers have to earn their money at half-time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3rwprd454ro"}
