I wanted to earn myself a new deal and I'm so grateful that it's happened,\" he said.\n\"We've got some really good young players and that's why I wanted to continue here. I feel like we can push on. We had a tough start to the season but since then we've been stable, and in the last few weeks we've been really strong â€“ hopefully that can continue.\"\nAlnwick, who has captained Cardiff 18 times this season, said: \"Getting that extra year, I'm delighted I'm going to be staying here longer now.\n\"I got a feeling when I first came down here, the way the club have supported me, the fans, everything about the place, it gives you a feeling of home. It's a special place and for me to be able to stay longer, I can't wait.\"\nRepublic of Ireland international O'Dowda, who recently made his 75th appearance for the club, said: \"I'm delighted. I think everyone can tell how much I've loved this city and representing the club over the past two and a half years. I'm really happy to get it over the line and kick on now.\n\"Coming to Cardiff City, it was a time in my career that revived everything for me. I'd say the love for the game and coming to a city like this, it brought it all back for me.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0qw540v2pwo"}
