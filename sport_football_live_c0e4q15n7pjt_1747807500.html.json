The goal was practically a carbon copy of Adams' earlier on as McGovern rose highest to head into the back of the net following a pinpoint delivery from Ciara Grant.\nCity struggled to deal with Hibs' pace and energy as the game wore on and did not manage to carve out any clear chances in the latter stages. Amy Muir fired over the hosts' crossbar in the final 10 minutes.\nVictory keeps Hibs level on points with Rangers, who defeated Spartans 3-0.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c0e4q15n7pjt"}
