He will remain here.\"\nConte reportedly wanted to sign the striker as a replacement for out-of-favour Spain forward Diego Costa.\nWalker left Tottenham for Man City 'to lift trophies'\nDanilo, 26, joined Real Madrid from Porto in 2015 but was the Spanish club's second-choice right-back for much of last season.\nHe started 17 La Liga matches for champions Real, with Dani Carvajal preferred for most of the big games, including the Champions League final.\nCity, who finished third in the Premier League last season, have already signed four players this summer - goalkeeper Ederson Moraes, right-back Walker and winger Bernardo Silva, plus teenage midfielder Douglas Luiz.\nSpeaking in the build-up to Thursday's pre-season game against Manchester United in Houston, Guardiola said they were talking to \"three or four\" more.\n\"They are young players, with the next three, four, five years in mind,\" he added.\n\"We have options for players coming, but until the deal is done, out of respect for the other clubs I cannot say anything.\"\nAs well as Danilo, City have also been linked with Monaco left-back Benjamin Mendy., external\nGuardiola said: \"Mendy is the same case as Danilo, we have targets and we see what happens. He's a Monaco player so I'm quiet in my comments.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40661051"}
