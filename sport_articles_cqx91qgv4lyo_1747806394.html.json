That just shows his longevity and that whatever he's doing [to look after himself] is just unbelievable, so he should just keep doing what he's doing.\n\"What he's doing at his age especially, how many catches that he had this season, how impactful he is when the time comes and when his number is called, he always steps up to the plate.\n\"He's a great veteran leader for that team. They wouldn't be where there are now, over the last couple of years, without Travis Kelce. He's been doing a phenomenal job at his age, big time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cqx91qgv4lyo"}
