That's the way it is,\" he told BBC Radio Bristol.\nLord Rees said he had a \"really warm welcome\" at the ceremony but added \"it can't escape me that it's really posh\".\n\"I want people from our backgrounds to get into those places,\" he added.\n\"We'll make the changes when we're there. The first thing is to get a wider range of people there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx29p562nwjo"}
