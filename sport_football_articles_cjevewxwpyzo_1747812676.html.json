For the rest of the season we need to be on it and put run of results together.\n\"This is not where Cardiff are supposed to be as a club, in my opinion.\n\"But the boys know that and it's about sticking together, getting through this and hopefully push on next season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjevewxwpyzo"}
