It's not easy. The turnaround from the Arsenal game was not that long. Two efforts in five days is big for us. Two clean sheets and six points, so I am delighted.\n\"The clean sheet was important. We have conceded too many goals this season. It's important to stem that. The collective effort to do that was important.\n\"We controlled the first half and limited them. Overall we're delighted and it is a big win for us.\"\nOn Tomas Soucek's birthday goal: \"He's been brilliant for us. He pops up with a goal and works hard. He can have some time over the weekend with his family and maybe have a nice dinner.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c8j00n4mn28o"}
