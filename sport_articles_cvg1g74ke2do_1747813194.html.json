He's on to 14 for the season at Hibs, exceeding last term's haul of 11.\nHe scored the clincher in September's 2-0 win over Saints and a goal on Saturday would mean he equals his highest tally at Hibs in season 2020-21.\nWith eight games to play, Boyle will surely fancy his chances of making the current campaign his most prolific.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvg1g74ke2do"}
