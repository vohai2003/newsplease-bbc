Nothing is a sure thing, but I thought he was a real safe bet for us.\n\"We knew we were getting a proven Premier League striker who was going to fit into our style of play, which is the most important thing. But even in terms of what I was hoping for, he's exceeded that.\n\"Dom has been outstanding in the way he has carried the frontline for us during this period. We put a lot of demands on that position. It's not just him standing up there scoring goals - it's working hard for the team.\n\"I really think if Richy [Richarlison] was available, I think he [Solanke] would have been able to contribute even greater for us in terms of his output in goals.\n\"He's been great for us and I really feel there is more to him and his game. We'll be able to get more out of him if we can get him some help.\"\nRicharlison, who has been sidelined for two months with a hamstring injury, is expected to be named in the travelling matchday squad for Wednesday's north London derby.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8yxx8e5ego"}
