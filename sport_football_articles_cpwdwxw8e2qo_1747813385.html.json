He has had a really difficult season, but I think he is finding his feet again.\n\"He isn't going to go to Newcastle and be a starter, and Liverpool have just given him a new deal. I can't see him leaving, and I would be devastated if he did. I think he has a massive upturn in potential - and he is in the England setup, so Thomas Tuchel clearly thinks that as well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpwdwxw8e2qo"}
