Even though I was training every day and I didn't necessarily have any problems, it was just my mind was going faster than my legs could move.\n\"It is very difficult and very frustrating to make mistakes you don't usually make.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0e4qp43q0vo"}
