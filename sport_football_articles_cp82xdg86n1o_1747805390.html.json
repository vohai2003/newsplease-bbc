I don't want to confirm anything until we have the final report this afternoon,\" said Arteta on Tuesday.\n\"It's the doctor's job to do that. But we were very worried after the game and we are very worried today.\"\nThe Arsenal boss also confirmed the club were \"actively looking\" at signing options this month given key forward Bukayo Saka is out until March and 17-year-old forward Ethan Nwaneri is also sidelined.\n\"It would be naive not to do that because there is always an opportunity to evolve the team and improve the squad, so yes, we are looking and let's see what we are able to do,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp82xdg86n1o"}
