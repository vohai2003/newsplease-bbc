We thought we were ready to compete the way that we want to play and go for it.\n\"In most of those games actually we have conceded goals early and haven't really nailed both in and out of possession.\n\"We don't want to lose 5-0, we don't want big numbers, but we still want to push the team forwards because in the end we will have that identity, that's the whole part of why we're here. It's a mixture of it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g0redex14o"}
