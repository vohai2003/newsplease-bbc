If you're knocking on the door, and you continue to knock on the door, those moments will come.\n\"Credit to the players to get the win and that bonus point which might be important in the end.\n\"There were a lot of positives aspects today. Huw [Jones] is a very, very good defender. Today he supported very well and it's great that he got those tries.\n\"There was a physical challenge today. The most important element today was the mental challenge. To come together as a team on the field to find solutions and find a way to win which will be important in the next games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn8xj0pnkllo"}
