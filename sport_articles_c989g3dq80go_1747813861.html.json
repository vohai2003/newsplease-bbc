We understand it's been a disappointing season overall. I'm hoping those four wins on the bounce sends them away feeling a wee bit better.\n\"I actually asked the fourth official what was going on and he thought it was a Kilmarnock player they were looking at. When Yan received the red, there was confusion int he dugout. I've not seen it back.\n\"It was another thing thrown at us today. Zander Clark came off injured, Ryan Fulton was injured second half. The players deserve huge credit for finding a way to win in what wasn't a good game.\n\"I'm naturally disappointed to be leaving the football club, but I tell the players all the time you've got a choice of what you do off a disappointment.\n\"I can choose to be angry or upset, but I'm choosing to be thankful and positive about the opportunity and the learnings. This experience will make me a better coach, manager, and person.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c989g3dq80go"}
