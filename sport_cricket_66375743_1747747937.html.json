They batted pretty well but we probably missed our line and length a little. They made it difficult when we were batting. I thought we had a little sniff when I was going but when Anya [Shrubsole] got me.\n\"We just didn't get going quickly enough with the bat. We faced too many dots. If we turn those into ones the target is more achievable. It also doesn't help when you get run out first ball! There is plenty to work on.\n\"We'll get used to playing with different people as the tournament goes on. We've spoken about those bonds before the tournament.\"\nWelsh Fire bowler Alex Hartley on BBC Two: \"Today showed that Southern Brave know how to win.\n\"They've lost two finals but they have a winning formula and know how to win in any situation. I reckon they can do it this year.\"\nYou can watch Hundred matches on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer every Wednesday and Saturday throughout the competition, alongside both finals on Sunday, 27 August.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/66375743"}
