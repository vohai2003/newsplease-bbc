Nottingham Forest away. Manchester United's run-in begins with at least 11 games left to play.\nSorry. A little rhyme for you there. I'm excited. This is exciting, isn't it? United are back after what feels like two years rather than two weeks.\nThe finish line of another turgid season is in sight, so let's look at three things that must happen if we are to enter the summer with even a sliver of satisfaction.\nMaintain \"big game\" momentum\nUnited have not been winning enough football matches at the start of Ruben Amorim's reign.

This one does not even rhyme like my epic opening.
