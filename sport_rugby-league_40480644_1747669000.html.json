He put me at ease because in my head I was thinking of retirement,\" said Clubb.\n\"Broken arms heal but with my injury I didn't know what was going to happen.\"\nA fault in the tube connecting to Clubb's kidney had effectively killed the organ, leaving no choice but to have it removed, and the surgeon's option to perform a keyhole operation was a success.\n\"The surgeon reassured me that I could be back training in eight weeks,\" he told BBC Radio Manchester. \"Doing a keyhole rather than full open surgery shortened the recovery time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/40480644"}
