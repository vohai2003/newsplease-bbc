Firstly, the goal at Upton Park when he found space that wasn't there - all in a flash of magic. Secondly, that pass for the sixth goal at Old Trafford - we started our Premier League domination that day!\nJohn: The best thing David Silva did was put a City shirt on for the first time because everything after that was pure brilliance. Never to be equalled by anyone.\nAJ: His first touch on his debut. Brought down a 50-yard cross-pitch ball and trapped it. I knew then we had bought a diamond. Harry Redknapp (the then Spurs manager) said Silva and Yaya looked a bit expensive, but Silva was simply priceless.\nKeith: There are so many magical touches from 'El Mago' David Silva to recall, but that exquisitely volleyed pass into the path of Edin Dzeko, who subsequently made it 6-1 at Old Trafford in 2011, does rather stick in the memory.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cl4mze8k08xo"}
