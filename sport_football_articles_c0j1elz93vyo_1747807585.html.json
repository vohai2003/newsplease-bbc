It was the moment that many of City's challengers felt that they were becoming helpless and were about to witness Pep Guardiola's players steamroll to a fourth consecutive Premier League title - and that is exactly what happened.\nKevin De Bruyne made the ultimate return from six-months out to slam home an excellent equaliser before providing a stunning assist for Oscar Bobb to score an incredible individual goal of his own and firmly break through into the first-team scene.\nThis was not only a glimpse at the sensational quality that Manchester City have at their disposal, capable of delivering league title after league title, but also a look towards the future, and the constant conveyor belt of world-beating talent being supplied to Pep Guardiola through the academy system.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0j1elz93vyo"}
