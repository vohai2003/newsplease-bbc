This time the unchallenged Victor Adeboyejo headed in from Williams' corner.\nBolton could not match their 4-0 win at QPR on the first day of the 2011-12 campaign but they added a third goal 16 minutes from time as Lincoln's new skipper Paudie O'Connor turned a cross from George Thomason - the substitute's first touch of the game - into his own net.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66345523"}
