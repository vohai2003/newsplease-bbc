On Wednesday we didn't perform and we got what we deserved, just like what we got what deserved in our previous two games by winning them because we had played well.\n\"We didn't play well on Wednesday, we accept that's why we lost the game. In football, you always have the opportunity to put things right and that comes against Kilmarnock.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/ce8vv837v54o"}
