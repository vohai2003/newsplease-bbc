We didn't defend the set plays well enough in the first half and then the one at the start of the second half is really poor. We knew the threat was on setpieces and the third goal is unacceptable from our point of view and from then on we were chasing.\n\"We need to stand up and be counted better. We have defended set pieces well all season, but we were unable to deal with them tonight. We were not strong enough from a maturity point of view and they handled it better than us when they were down to 10 men.\n\"We had some good spells in the first half, we started the game really well and we can have a high level, we've had spells like that in nearly all the games.\n\"Tonight it is on us, we have to own it. It's not a night where we're feeling many positives, we let one get away from us. We need to learn from tonight, we played against a group of players that showed their maturity and quality.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cewkklnqvn1o"}
