I've given everything in the last 10 days, and four years before that, to be here.\"\nKerr, 29, watched from the sidelines as her side edged the Republic of Ireland 1-0 in their opening match in Sydney and then saw them lose a lead and go down 3-2 to Nigeria in Brisbane.\nThat result left the Matildas in third place in Group B and needing a victory over second-placed Olympic champions Canada on Monday to guarantee a place in the knockout stages.\nNigeria, who currently top the group on goal difference, face bottom side the Republic of Ireland in Group B's other match.\nHer Australia team-mate Ellie Carpenter said: \"Sam is a great leader and a great captainâ€¦ and we've really felt her there on the sidelines.\n\"We're all supporting her, and it's great for her to have her boots back on, as she's a world-class player.\n\"Mentally, it's massive to have her available, and for the opposition too, knowing we have her available for this game. We're excited to have her back in the squad.\"\nMatildas coach Tony Gustavsson previously said they would wait until the last minute to make a decision on Kerr's fitness.\n\"If she's available we're going to need to come up with a plan together to see what we can do to maximise the potential minutes she has - if she's available,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66339701"}
