He was sent off for 'an elbow' and therefore violent conduct, but VAR Gavin Duncan pointed out to the referee that there was 'no elbow contact'.\nUltimately, Stephen Robinson will be frustrated. His side edged large parts of the game and did have chances through Toyosi Olusanya, but he was not able to drag his side back into the match.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cn5275724p6o"}
