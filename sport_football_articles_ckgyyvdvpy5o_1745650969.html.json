But losing their top scorer and someone who had scored in each of his two previous visits to Anfield was not only a blow for Newcastle but a boost for Liverpool.\"\nEddie Howe is set to speak to the media on Friday morning before Sunday's FA Cup fifth round tie with Brighton and is expected to provide an update on Isak's condition.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ckgyyvdvpy5o"}
