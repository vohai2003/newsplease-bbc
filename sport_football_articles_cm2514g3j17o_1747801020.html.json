It's always easier for the away team to open the contest and use our strengths in counter-attacks.\n\"It always helps, instead of the other team being able to concentrate on being rock-solid, compact and good in defending, and you have to defend some counter-attacks, so it's a problem.\n\"I would like to be in the lead at some point in an away game, it would make our lives a bit easier. You can have wishes and dreams but they can't all happen in some periods of the season, so we just have to have reality and dig and grind out, and this was a hard-fought point.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2514g3j17o"}
