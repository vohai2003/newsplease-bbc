Some tries left out there but I'm happy with the result.\n\"We're getting better as a group and we didn't want to disappoint.\n\"Leinster pose a completely different challenge. They know how to handle strategic moments in the game. They've got the complete package, a good rush defence - they put you under pressure.\n\"It's going to be difficult with guys coming back in the next few weeks. We'll see how we approach this week. The boys out there tonight played well, but one or two fresh players might add value.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g3pxgwn2ko"}
