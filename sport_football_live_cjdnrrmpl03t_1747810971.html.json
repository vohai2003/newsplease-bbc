We try to find the positives and keep going.\"\nBrighton will be left wondering how they failed to secure all three points.\nTheir football in the first half, led by the talented Kaoru Mitoma and Enciso, was a joy to watch.\nAs well as hitting the post, Enciso also missed three other good chances. Matt O'Riley had two decent attempts and Mitoma fired into the side netting, with those on the other side of the ground thinking the ball had gone into the net.\nBrentford suffered a blow midway through the first half when first-choice goalkeeper Mark Flekken suffered an injury to his right thigh after he had to twist quickly to keep out Mitoma's deflected cross.\nThat handed a Premier League debut to 23-year-old Hakon Valdimarsson.\nThe Iceland international joined the club in a Â£2.6m deal from Swedish side Elfsborg in the summer and had only made two appearances - against Colchester United and Leyton Orient in the Carabao Cup\nHowever, Brighton could not test the back-up keeper in a tame second half.\nThe Seagulls played in European competition for the first time last season, reaching the last 16 of the Europa League with Roberto de Zerbi in charge.\nA month ago it looked like Brighton, now coached by Fabian Hurzeler, would be pushing for European qualification again for the 2025-26 campaign.\nA 2-1 win at Bournemouth on 23 November left Brighton fifth, level on points with Chelsea and Arsenal and dreaming of making a push for a Champions League place.\nThey have not won since.\nA win could have taken them seventh, but they remain 10th and have only got four points from six matches - draws against Southampton, Leicester, West Ham and now Brentford along with 3-1 losses to both Fulham and Crystal Palace.\nMeanwhile, Brentford moved up to 11th, above Tottenham, despite picking up 22 of their 24 points at home and they had to work hard to gain only their second point on their travels.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cjdnrrmpl03t"}
