I would like to reduce the number of goals conceded. That was better on Sunday but tomorrow is a very good test again.\"\nHe said \"there are a lot of teams fighting\" for a European spot so they need to \"be more consistent playing at the level\" he expects from them.\nOn the quick turnaround from Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final at Preston: \"We are happy. Of course, four days to rest is better than three, but it is not an excuse. We are not focusing on that. We are just trying to prepare as best as possible for this match. Rest, good food and being less on the field, and more analysis.\"\nHe said he will be assessing which of his players are \"full of energy and physically ready to play\" again and a decision will be made hours before the game.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7vn6jn03p8o"}
