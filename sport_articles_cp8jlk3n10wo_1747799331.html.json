If you look at this calendar year so far, by 6 April, they've already lost four.\n\"So I don't think it's time for ringing any alarm bells yet, but equally I think it does show that Celtic probably aren't as good a team as people thought they were.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cp8jlk3n10wo"}
