You can give the foul to both sides. You can never give a penalty for a situation like that. That was a decisive moment. It gave Hibs a lot of energy and belief.\n\"We played a very good first half. We found the spaces like we wanted to and we could have scored more than the two goals. Second half, it was more in the balance. Hibs had to force and we were maybe too patient and not killers enough to score the third.\n\"That's the next step to take with this team, the game management in those moments, but getting a penalty like that changes the momentum. We reacted really well, scored the third goal in a good way and then you lose a duel on a set-piece for 3-3. It's totally not what the team deserved.\"\nAsked about the possibility of reinforcements this month...\n\"Those are questions for [CEO] Patrick [Stewart]. How the club sees things, so he will address that in the short-term.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c93gzx114ggo"}
