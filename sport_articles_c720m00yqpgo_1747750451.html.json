Second half, we were very good. There were chances at both ends but the least we deserved was to come away with was a draw.\n\"It's amazing really. You come here with two defenders in Leon [Balogun] and Johnly [Yfeko] and you end the game with no central defenders. Those are the scenarios that might happen in the season. It wasn't ideal in terms of preparation but there was some good play again today.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c720m00yqpgo"}
