There was a period where I was scoring quite frequently and I haven't had that feeling for quite a long time.\n\"I think we had a few clear-cut chances that we should have taken in the first half and put the game to bed. It's across football globally, if you have chances and you don't take them then it can come back and hurt you.\nOn David Brooks potential red card: \"When the referee takes a look at the monitor then it's never a good sign.\n\"There are positives to take away from the game but there are negatives as well. It's mixed emotions.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ydx1gnq4lo"}
