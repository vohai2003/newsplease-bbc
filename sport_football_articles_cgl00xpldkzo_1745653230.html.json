His recovery tackling is excellent. His speed and energy to take him up and down the pitch is first class. He is strong. And, crucially, his confidence is building, which will make him more secure when he does have the ball.\nQuite a lot has been said about the value of West Ham's summer transfer window splurge. The exits of manager Julen Lopetegui and technical director Tim Steidten tell their own story on that.\nBut bringing Wan Bissaka back to London was an astute move. West Ham will benefit from that, now and in the future.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgl00xpldkzo"}
