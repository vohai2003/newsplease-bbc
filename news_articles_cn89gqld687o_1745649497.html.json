How can my delivery people come on a morning?' You do not get a response.\n\"There will be days we cannot trade.\"\nLucy Grogan from the Transpennine Route Upgrade project said representatives had met with \"several of the local businesses around Cross Gates\" to \"discuss their concerns\".\nShe said they would \"continue to engage\" to ensure everybody was informed about the upcoming work.\n\"We have planned our construction carefully to enable one lane to remain open to help maintain access and minimise disruption, however there are eight days when the road will need to be closed for safety.\n\"Access to all businesses will be maintained throughout the works.\n\"The reconstruction of Station Road bridge to create room for electrical overhead lines to be installed is a key step in enabling faster, greener and more frequent electric trains to run between York, Leeds, Huddersfield and Manchester.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here, external.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn89gqld687o"}
