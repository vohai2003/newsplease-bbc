However, commentating over his assist for Nathan Broadhead's goal in their 2-1 win over Bournemouth, which included a powerful dribble where he was able to hold off and outpace three defenders, was a reminder of the game-changing quality the 21-year-old possesses.\nEnciso is proven at Premier League level. However, apart from Liam Delap, all of Ipswich's attacking options have struggled to make a consistent impact this season.\nWith manager Kieran McKenna confirming to me injuries to Lief Davis and Omari Hutchinson, the pair who sit at the top of Ipswich's chances created stats list, the need for Enciso to rediscover his best form on a regular basis could not be greater.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czx4rql7djjo"}
