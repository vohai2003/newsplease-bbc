Only Celtic, Rangers, Hibs and Aberdeen are assured a finish in the top half.\nDundee United, Hearts, St Mirren and Motherwell are all vying for the final two places and County are not arithmetically out of the race just yet.\nFor Motherwell and their new manager Michael Wimmer, securing a place among the elite would vindicate his recent appointment.\nThe German has two wins and a draw from his opening five games, including a victory at Ibrox. However, Saturday's 4-1 loss at Aberdeen was a setback as St Mirren and United made gains with wins.\nOn Saturday, the Fir Park side take a trip to face a Kilmarnock team smarting from a 5-1 defeat by St Mirren and already consigned to the bottom six.\nMotherwell are unbeaten in the fixture going back almost 16 months and maintaining that record could be crucial to where Wimmer's side end this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0l0g6jp1leo"}
