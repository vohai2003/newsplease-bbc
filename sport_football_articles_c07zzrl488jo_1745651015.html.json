We were very passive and looking for safety by going back. We sat too deep and lacked initiative.\n\"We need to push forward and play with some courage. We need to not be afraid to make mistakes but I understand that the confidence levels are very low. That showed in the first half. We get so passive because of that and we were not in the game. At least in the second half we went for it and created some opportunities.\n\"Players look for safety by going backwards, not forwards. At least in the second half, they showed what they were capable of that. That's the way forward.\n\"In the right moments, we put the opponent under pressure and took initiative in the game. That's the way we have to continue.\n\"We have to approach the games with initiative and not be afraid to lose. That was the difference between the first and second half.\n\"Confidence is a big part of this.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c07zzrl488jo"}
