We didn't have the cutting edge and you have to give them some credit for the way they came and defended.\n\"I've already seen them twice this season. They're hard to get through. They know when to foul and when to kill the clock.\n\"We we allowed them to score from a set play. We're definitely missing Kyle Bartley. He's the most dominant defender we have in the box - and he's a big voice.\n\"But they also scored a decent second goal on the break and, although we got the ball in the back of their net, they were both ruled out.\"\nBlackburn Rovers interim boss David Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire:\n\"It's been a difficult week, so to come to a place like this and perform like we did in and out of possession was a great credit to the lads.\n\"Our defensive organisation was really good and, up front, Makhtar Gueye looks a real handful.\n\"He's taken time to settle in, but we've been working a lot with him â€“ and he took his goals really well.\n\"It's sad to see John Eustace and the other two coaches go. They've worked really hard here. We'll just keep on going until an announcement is made. And we're now just focusing on Saturday.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c74ed4gg1y2t"}
