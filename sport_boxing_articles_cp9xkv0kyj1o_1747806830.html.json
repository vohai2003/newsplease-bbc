Obviously I don't want to be naked in front of everyone.\"\nThe two fighters will contest the IBO title at Wembley Arena.\nAzim, 22, is unbeaten in 12 fights and is looking to step up to world title level in 2025.\nLipinets, 35, has 18 wins, one draw and three losses on his record and held the IBF title in 2017.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cp9xkv0kyj1o"}
