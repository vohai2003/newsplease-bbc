That is now a distant memory other than the thought of how much better it could have been but for that slow start.\nForget that. This is where we are.\nAn FA Cup semi-final to look forward to and well positioned for an interesting run to the end of the season which could yet yield a top-10 finish.\nThe dream for all Palace fans is to win a trophy. The Zenith Data Systems victory is a distance memory, which is laughable to most fans, but those that were around in those heady early 1990s will remember it well.\nThat was not long after the FA Cup final disappointment of 1990, and we have had one more since then, so is it third time lucky?\nFootball is all about dreaming but there is no getting carried away. We know it will be a difficult summer to hold on to our star players and the manager, so enjoy the ride while we can in case the worst does happen (which often does to teams like Palace!).\nFailing a trophy, Palace fans would love a European adventure, no matter how it happened or where it would take us.\nIt has been a long wait but the time is now with such an influential manager in charge of the club and making us look up the table rather than down.\nOliver Glasner masterminded an excellent end to last season. If he can encourage his players to produce anything similar, we are looking at a fun couple of months.\nYou have to dream, before your dreams come true, and Glasner has made us dreamers again.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c985yke66rko"}
