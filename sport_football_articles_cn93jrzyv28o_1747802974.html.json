Erling Haaland has only been substituted twice in the Premier League. Otherwise, he has played every single minute thus far this season.\nThe excessive use of the Norwegian, as important as he is to City, does not seem sustainable.\nHence, Marmoush might be the one to carry some of the load up front. But paying this kind of sum for a glorified back-up would be unreasonable. Instead, Marmoush could also work well in a two-striker set-up with Haaland.\nAt Eintracht Frankfurt, he occasionally featured on the wings, While he is nowhere near the dribbler Jeremy Doku or Savinho is, he brings a certain degree of cleverness on the flank.\nStriker might be Marmoush's prime position, but his versatility is a big plus.\nIt is easy to understand why Guardiola fancies a tactically flexible and smart forward like him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn93jrzyv28o"}
