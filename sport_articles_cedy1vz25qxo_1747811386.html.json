We are in a huge transitional period with new owners, manager, style of play and players themselves. It takes time to rebuild with the new vision. We couldn't lay a glove on Hibs.\nGordy: No future with Simo Valakari and certainly no way out of the Championship next season. Relegation is now a near certainty. His rigidity in tactics and player selection, particularly at the end of last year, was lamentable and nothing has changed.\nIan: That was as bad as it has been this season, it looks like we're going down with a whimper unless there is a dramatic turnaround. There was no purpose to our possession and passing, always going sideways and backwards from good positions. Passes don't win games, goals do. We need to remember that.\nGreg: It wasn't a game we expected to win but the performance was nothing short of shocking. Tensions ran high at the end, with harsh words exchanged between fans and the manager. At this point, relegation feels almost inevitable.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cedy1vz25qxo"}
