The club is on the right way. Is it fast enough to win everything? That's our ambition.\n\"We need to create this culture and more and more I see it. They know what it means to play for this club.\"\nIt's worth emphasising just how rocky the path was for Rangers to finish in the top eight, having started the final matchday in 13th place in the standings.\nThey ended up playing four of the other seven teams who went straight to the last 16 in Manchester United, Tottenham, Lyon and Olympiakos.\nDuring the eight matches they ended up playing seven different back-four combinations due to a series of casualties.\nRight-back Neraysho Kasanwirjo played left-back against Malmo before he suffered a season-ending injury.\nLeft-back Ridvan Yilmaz had to play right-back against two Premier League sides, while James Tavernier ended up at centre-back against Manchestr United and Union.\nAt Ibrox against the Belgians, diminutive right winger Ross McCausland filled in on the right of defence after Leon King was forced off inside the first quarter with a head knock.\nIn their final two games, Rangers finished with several teenagers on the pitch.\nAll that considered, the resilience was seriously impressive as they finished eighth having only been outscored by three sides.\n\"Maybe we don't have the talent of other teams - but it's about mentality,\" Clement said. \"The belief was there from the first day but it's about digging in and giving everything we have.\n\"We had to be very creative the last few months but we've done it brilliantly.\n\"Massive clubs with massive budgets have finished behind us, and around us, the achievement is only bigger by beating four of the seven top teams.\"\nRangers can now wait and watch next month's knockout round play-offs, knowing they will play either Bodo/Glimt, Anderlecht, Twente or Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.\nAll will pose a challenge, but none will strike fear into Rangers' hearts.\nOf the current squad, only Tavernier and Leon Balogun played a big role in their run to the final in 2022, when they suffered penalty heartbreak against Eintracht Frankfurt.\nThat shows the scale of the change at Ibrox in just a few years. However, the club seems to have muscle memory when it comes to the Europa League.\nHaving already played four of the top seven and only been outclassed by Lyon so far, and with no teams dropping down from the Champions League this year, they will fancy another deep run.\nPlus they can now add players to their squad who they did not initially register, such as Danilo and Ianis Hagi, and also wait for some of their injured players to return.\nMcCausland was asked after the match if he thinks they can go all the way.\n\"Definitely, 100%,\" was his reply.\nWhether they do or not, Rangers fans can strap themselves in for another Europa League adventure in the spring.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y7j7z373go"}
