The result will help. We struggled, but it is a relief.\n\"There were glimpses of brilliance. The work ethic was unbelievable, but still not the composure. We accelerate everything.\n\"We have struggled with results recently but the last two victories are good and we did not lose for three games.\n\"I would say a month and half [of poor form] compared to eight years is not bad.\"\nOn Savinho: \"He was brilliant. He is one of the few players that is fresh.\"\nOn having the clinical touch: \"Absolutely. We were lucky with the first goal. They were better in the first minutes, we could have gone 0-1 or 0-2.\n\"The second goal helped us. It was an incredible goal but we are still not like we were.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c74xeed9gkko"}
