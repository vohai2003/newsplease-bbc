We wanted to start the game on the front foot, and we did. Then we said: 'Let's keep going for more'.\n\"We know how it felt last week and we wanted to make sure that Brighton felt the same.\n\"It is always nice to contribute. You could see I kept on running at the end because I wanted a goal. I said to Chris [Wood] at half time: 'Let's keep pushing for more', so I'm happy he got the hat-trick of goals.\n\"The most important thing is to win - and we did that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c863vpe72qvo"}
