We knew that they were strong and they'd run in the channels. They are a really good team and incredibly well managed but we created a lot of chances. I'm happy to go through.\"\nOn whether he felt his side struggled in the first-half: \"I don't think so. The first 10/15 minutes maybe but after the fantastic goal that they had - we took the game and created a lot of chances.\"\nOn whether he was frustrated that he had to bring on Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne: \"Absolutely not, that is why they are here. We talk this competition incredibly seriously and we thought it was the best decision to make. I am happy for Kevin's goal, his movement was really good.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqjv178ggr4o"}
