Players must be patient, responsible and respectful for who's playing.\"\nThat includes Monday's FA Cup fifth-round tie at home against Ipswich Town, in which Matz Sels is expected to return to the matchday line-up following Carlos Miguel's injury.\nExperienced goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is not \"the best decision\" added Nuno.\n\"I think Matz should start again. It's very difficult for a goalkeeper to come into the team. Wayne [Hennessey] is doing a fantastic job but he got injured last season so it's about getting him back.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cd652w70y3lo"}
