I'm not concerned in the sense that they're sitting mid-table, they're not going to be in a relegation battle, not from what I can see,\" Caulker told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\"But they have drifted away from the play-offs and that's a shame because for me Swansea and Cardiff are two teams that, at the very least, should be competing in and around the play-offs\n\"They're two teams that have been in the Premier League and got Premier League experience and the fans, of course, want to see them back there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3d54km1r13o"}
