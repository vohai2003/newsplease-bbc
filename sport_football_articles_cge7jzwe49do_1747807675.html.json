He was one of the players I said people should watch out for this season, but that has turned out the way most of my predictions do.\nFulham are a good team, but some of their recent results have been a bit strange.\nThey are eight league games unbeaten and safely into round four of the FA Cup but that run includes a couple of home draws, against Southampton and Ipswich, where I expected them to win.\nI am still erring more towards a Fulham win than towards West Ham but, because Marco Silva's side have turned into draw specialists, I am going to go for another draw here too.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cge7jzwe49do"}
