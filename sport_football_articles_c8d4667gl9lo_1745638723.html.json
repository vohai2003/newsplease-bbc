Focus on what you are doing and do your best. Anything can happen. It's a massive result away from home in a competition that we love, that we missed for so many years. Today is a really special night for us.\"\nOn teenagers Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly: \"To be doing what they are doing at 17 and 18 years old shows incredible maturity. They are doing that because of how the other players support them and make them better. They have a lot of courage. Myles makes an assist, that's the team that I want to see, they take initiative and they want to make things happen.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c8d4667gl9lo"}
