He was so pivotal to that City team being at its best and it's telling that City have dropped off dramatically as he has been injured and missed games. They've not been the same without him and it has made a huge impact in how City have progressed this season.\n\"It's a big job to replace De Bruyne. Phil Foden was pegged to replace him - he was PFA Player of the Year and everyone thought this was the time for him to fill De Bruyne's boots. He is someone who can pick passes, score goals and influence the team but he's dropped off as well.\n\"De Bruyne was consistent every week and his standard was so high - to find a player like that is almost impossible.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm25j453j5yo"}
