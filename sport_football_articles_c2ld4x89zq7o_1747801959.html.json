Yeah I want it, but I try to be honest with myself for that.\n\"They have to fight. You can say it's unfair. OK, if you think that, then it's fine, but you have to prove [to me], 'OK, I'm going to fight with Savinho, to deserve to play in that position', every single day, every single week and every single month.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2ld4x89zq7o"}
