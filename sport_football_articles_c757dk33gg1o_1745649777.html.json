It has been too long and took a while. It isn't what I wanted when I joined but it was lovely to share that moment with the supporters at the end,\" Bloomfield told BBC Three Counties Radio.\n\"This result doesn't dissipate the disappointment of recent weeks, that is going to drive us on, but it will build belief.\n\"If you look at recent home games we have started games fast and it is the same today. Getting the first goal proved to be a decisive moment.\n\"I didn't think there were going to be too many goals in it today so to get ahead and give ourselves something to defend was what we needed. I thought the character and discipline in the second half was fantastic.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c757dk33gg1o"}
