However, while earlier in the season they were being well beaten it's now three away losses in row in by a single goal in games they probably didn't deserve to lose.\nThe first half was a physical battle and as bad a spectacle as you could witness. Millwall strangely sat back after scoring and Pompey's goal came after their best spell of the game\nBut as at Preston, after doing the hard bit, Pompey couldn't hold on for a point, with Millwall sending in one more ball into the box than Portsmouth could cope with.\nPompey remain in a good position to avoid relegation but the pressure on home matches will be ginormous if they keep losing away.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93glqpvjy9o"}
