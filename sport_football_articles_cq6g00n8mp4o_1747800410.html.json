He seems to be getting quicker, at the age of 38, and is still scoring really important goals for them.\nIt was Everton's victory at Brighton that impressed me the most, though.\nThey are still not going to be free-scoring but the centre-back partnership between James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite, with Jordan Pickford behind them, has given new boss David Moyes the foundation he wants.\nI am backing them to edge this game too, which would give Moyes a hat-trick of wins and a bit of breathing space over the bottom four.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cq6g00n8mp4o"}
