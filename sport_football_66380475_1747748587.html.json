We work on set-pieces every game. I should be more clinical at times and I am working on that.\n\"We want to play at the highest level and compete with these teams and players. They punished us at times and that's how it is. We're still in pre-season and we've had big changes.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66380475"}
