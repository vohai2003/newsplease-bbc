They defended in a low block and it was quite good. We weren't able to create any more chances. The first goal changed the game.\n\"It was frustrating in that moment to concede a goal so easily. We were dominant. We needed a bit of time. We scored but it was disallowed. It was a mix of everything but we have to do it better.\n\"These are the things we can influence on the pitch. How we are positioned off the corner and high pressure. We need to do these right otherwise you don't deserve to win.\n\"I would say we were just not precise. I don't think the maturity would have made the difference today.\n\"Do the small things right. To do the things we need to win on the pitch. These we have to maximize. We have to work on this and we have to take the next chance on Saturday.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpvrzkrkex1o"}
