Cole holds the record with 65 appearances - which Haaland would break if he nets 14 times in his next 29 games.\nEven by Haaland's superhuman scoring rate, there is one landmark he probably won't be catching.\nDixie Dean hit an unprecedented 60 top-flight goals for Everton in 1927-28 - Haaland fell 24 goals short of that last season.\nBut he might have a chance at beating Dean's 63 goals in all competitions that season, which is a record for an English top-flight player.\nHaaland scored 52 goals in his debut campaign with City, second only to Dean - but at one stage it looked as if he might break it.\nThe former Borussia Dortmund striker was on 50 goals with 10 games for City left, but only netted twice in that time.\nFinish the season stronger this time and he might well do it.\nBut he would have to really up that scoring ratio to catch Lionel Messi's 73 goals in all competitions for Barcelona in 2011-12.\nHaaland is Norway's joint-fourth top scorer with 24 goals in 25 games.\nHe is nine off Jorgen Juve's national record of 33 goals scored between 1928-1937.\nNorway have six games scheduled before the end of November - and will have more next year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66234304"}
