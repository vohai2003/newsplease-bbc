It was a no-brainer to recommit to the club\n\"Another reason why I wanted to re-sign was that I can see the potential the club has - the boys that are coming through and the talent that is here. I want to be part of that.\n\"There are exciting times ahead. I think we have shown signs of that this year and hopefully we can keep on building over the coming years.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cg72gp909dlo"}
