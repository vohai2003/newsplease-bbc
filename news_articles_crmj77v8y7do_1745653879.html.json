A jury at Southwark Crown Court on Monday determined he was responsible for the attack.\nJudge Gregory Perrins said Bourne would stay in a secure hospital \"indefinitely\".\nJudge Perrins said live-in housekeeper Ms Nascimento had been watching TV in her room when Bourne knocked on her door and told her to come out on the evening of 25 February 2024.\n\"He then viciously and brutally attacked her, stabbing her repeatedly with a kitchen knife to her head and her body,\" the judge said.\n\"She was attacked without warning and without provocation in the home in which she lived and worked. It is only through sheer good fortune that she survived the attack.\"\nThe court heard Ms Nascimento managed to get free and lock herself in a bathroom, before finding her phone and contacting a friend.\nIn a written statement previously read in court, the housekeeper said: \"I told him I have a daughter and I pleaded with him to stop.\n\"He told me that it was because I was evil, but we had never had an argument or a disagreement.\"\nJudge Perrins told the court Ms Nascimento had permanent scars causing her \"intense\" pain and she suffered with mental health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmj77v8y7do"}
