It is whether they take them this time. I am backing them to stick a couple away.\nOf course this derby is really important to Ange Postecoglou and Tottenham in their situation, but the expansive way they play means it is tall order to expect an unfamiliar defence and new goalkeeper to step up again.\nI do see Spurs scoring, but they give up a lot of chances. Arsenal have to win this game to hang on in the title race, and I think they will.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0k58108v63o"}
