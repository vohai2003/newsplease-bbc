I've said it all the time, just get the ball in the right areas and this Rams team have got players there that can attack the ball.\n\"Credit to Callum Elder again putting the ball into the right areas, Nat Phillips attacking the ball. Fantastic.\n\"And obviously the finishingâ€¦ Craig Forsyth, really good finish on his left foot and Jerry Yates, Johnny-on-the-spot in the six-yard box for 2-0.\n\"Derby players warmly applauded the fans who were terrific again. To hear the crowd and just to see that league table. How much better does this feel?\"\nChristie said \"this is what we've wanted\" and that Eustace was \"as animated as we've seen him\" at full-time.\n\"He's loving it, as the players should and as the fans should as well,\" Christie added.\n\"It's been a long, hard slog of a season in many respects and finally things are looking up and not down at the moment.\n\"Credit to the support base that stuck by this team and finally we've got something to put smiles on our faces, which is brilliant.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g2xdg6jxeo"}
