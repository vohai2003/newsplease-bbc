We were very comfortable on FFP during the years just after promotion and before the covid pandemic, because of a relatively low wage bill, low-cost signings from the Championship and relatively stronger finishes in the league and Europe.\"\nWolves have struggled to make signings this summer - Bristol City's Alex Scott looks like joining Bournemouth despite long-standing interest from Molineux. Big-name players have also left.\nBut Shi remains confident despite flirting with relegation last season.\n\"The Premier League is very unpredictable and challenging, especially with new types of ownership at some clubs bringing unprecedented investment,\" he added.\n\"However, I am very confident in our squad.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c72vlg135e9o"}
