Then we lacked control, gave the ball away and we didn't do the simple things well enough to be really on top of the game and have the dominance we required.\n\"The game was always open without really conceding anything.\"\nOn the Brighton penalty: \"We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life. He touches the ball as well.\"\nOn the second-half performance: \"We did a lot of things not to the standard with the ball, so we didn't get any momentum. We never got set in areas so that afterwards we could generate chances and counter-press in the right moment.\n\"We conceded one chance when we had 10 players on the floor and [Yankuba] Minteh takes off. I think we have to do much better things than today and unfortunately we lost two points.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy3zznx5e0o"}
