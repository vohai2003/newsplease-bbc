That is key for us.\" He would not be drawn on whether Kieran Tierney will join the club this month amid reports that Arsenal will keep the defender in north London until the summer.\nRodgers revealed he expects Luis Palma to leave Celtic this month to sign for an unnamed club on a loan deal with an option to buy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckgrleze181o"}
