Five goals in two games is a phenomenal return, but the run before that was far less impressive.\nMaybe the real gift is a financial one to Arsenal. There are many other teams out there desperate for a striker, the transfer window will soon be opening and Jesus has suddenly become much more valuable than he was this time last week.\nSo even though his form is stunning just now, don't be surprised if he is traded to make way for a player the club thinks will be a better longer-term bet.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g2rezv75zo"}
