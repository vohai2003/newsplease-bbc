With eight games to go, they only have a slim chance of survival but at least they do have a chance, and they could put their nearest rivals under a bit of pressure by beating them here.\nThey have already beaten Wolves once this season, at Molineux in December, in Gary O'Neil's final game in charge of Wolves, and beating them again at home to get their second win this week would be huge when you consider they had only won three of their first 29 league games.\nMy head is not exactly convinced that will happen, if I am being entirely honest, even though Wolves' best player Matheus Cunha is still out suspended.\nMr Fields would probably prefer me not to tip Town to win anyway because I have usually been wrong when I've done that in the past, but I am going to say they will get over the line because I want him to be happy.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7vnenp8lz3o"}
