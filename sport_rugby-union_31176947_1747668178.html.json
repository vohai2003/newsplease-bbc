We started the way we'd spoken about and then let ourselves down.\n\"People say that we're renowned for starting slowly but we started quick and maybe just took the foot off the pedal a bit.\"\nWales led 10-0 within the opening nine minutes thanks to Rhys Webb's try and a conversion and penalty by Leigh Halfpenny.\nEngland fought back through a George Ford penalty and an Anthony Watson try before Dan Biggar's drop-goal gave Wales an eight point cushion at the break.\nBut the visitors dominated the second half, with Jonathan Joseph's converted try and two late Ford penalties giving them a deserved win.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/31176947"}
