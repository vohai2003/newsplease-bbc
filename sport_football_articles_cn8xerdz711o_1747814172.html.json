We know those games can be banana skins the longer they stay 0-0. You can feel the anxiety around the place and it jus builds. Thankfully this guy [Dane Scarlett] comes on and changes the game. A good win overall.\n\"He [Scarlett] came on in a game that was quite tough at times and he changed it for us. Dane's worked so hard over the last few years that I have been here with him. He's had to go on loan, play limited minutes in lots of games too. But to come on and play the way he did in that game was amazing. Nothing short of what he deserves.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn8xerdz711o"}
