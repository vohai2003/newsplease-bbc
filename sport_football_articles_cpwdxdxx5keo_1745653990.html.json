But he also understands his squad is ring-fenced from the cuts.\nAs he rightly pointed out, they are the engine of the club. Even reducing the standard of hotels United stay in is off limits because it could have a negative effect on performance.\nThat is a heavy burden.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cpwdxdxx5keo"}
