It's a really good day for the group, Aston Villa next week is a challenge up from this.\"\nOn Jack Clarke, who scored twice and made one: \"We're delighted for Jack. He has really shown good signs. He joined us late in the [summer] window and has stepped up to the Premier League for the first time. But he's a really talented footballer, a good athlete and a good lad. He is making some progress and showed that today.\"\nOn goalkeeper Alex Palmer's debut following his Â£5m move from West Brom, he said: \"He did really well and it was the perfect opportunity to bring him in against an opponent that he has already faced this season. He stepped straight into the team and showed his quality.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c87d2jzr7jvo"}
