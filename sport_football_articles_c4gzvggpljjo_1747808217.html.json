Sometimes you just have to take these ones on the chin,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately, in a way, football happens. And we could always look at what we could have done to stop it. The first goal, it's nothing because it's a great finish and the second, yes, but the players gave everything.\n\"We did a lot of good things in the game. We've had lots of possession in the games we've had so far and today it was less so because we know they are a possession team, so we set up [for that] and the players did everything right until the last few minutes.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gzvggpljjo"}
