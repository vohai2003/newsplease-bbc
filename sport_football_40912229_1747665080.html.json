But the contract doesn't mean anything.\"\nThe 45-year-old former France international, who managed Real's B team before replacing Rafael Benitez in January 2016, added: \"You can sign for 10, 20 years. I know where I am and what to do.\n\"In one year, maybe I won't be here. Real Madrid and I are not going to argue, never.\"\nReal visit Barca on Sunday with the game kicking off at 21:00 BST, with the second leg on Wednesday at the Bernabeu (22:00 BST).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40912229"}
