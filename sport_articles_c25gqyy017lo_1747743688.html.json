He’s a super professional guy and whenever he goes into training he gives 100 per cent and it’s the same as all the lads so not (a distraction) at all really.\n“We were friends before I joined Tottenham from the England squad. We have similar interests and get on well anyway away from football.\n“I would love Harry Kane to stay, he’s the best number nine in the world in my opinion, but what will be, will be and Harry is super professional.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c25gqyy017lo"}
