We had so many chances. We know we have to be clinical, otherwise the game is always open, and we conceded a goal.\n\"Sometimes you are going to win at the end, sometimes lose and sometimes draw.\n\"We were in control of the ball, lost it and then conceded. If we had been more clinical before the goal was scored then the game could have been finished. We had three or four clear chances for 2-0 and to kill the game but, at 1-0, they got belief and unfortunately we conceded.\n\"Josh Acheampong was fantastic for us. We really trust Josh and it's just a matter of the right path for him, but he will be an important player for the club.\n\"When you don't win three or four games, it is normal that the rest will come closer to you. In the last four games, we have drawn two and lost two - so the gap [between the top four] is closer, but there are still 18 games to go.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gp5580egwo"}
