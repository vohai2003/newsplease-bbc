Kieren Flavell produced a string of point-blank saves before his parry fell to Trevitt, who swept home into an empty net.\nThere was confusion before half-time as Exeter appeared to have doubled their lead through Caleb Watts following a set-piece. However, the effort was ruled out for a foul in the build-up.\nBarnsley drew the game level through Humphrys 13 minutes into the second half. Davis Keillor-Dunn broke at pace and found his strike partner, who finished emphatically past Joe Whitworth.\nHowever, the Grecians produced a rare attack nine minutes from time and made it count as captain Magennis overpowered his marker and slotted a low finish in at the near post.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/czdndp471gqt"}
