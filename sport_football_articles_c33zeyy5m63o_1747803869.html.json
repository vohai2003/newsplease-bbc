I think it probably hit me three weeks into being here that I was like: 'Oh gosh, I've just upped and left.'\n\"In football, when certain things come, certain opportunities come, you have to take it. For me to experience a different league, a different culture - for me to play for a club like AC Milan - I don't think you can turn that down.\n\"There's certain clubs in the world that you kind of can't say no to.\n\"The talks didn't happen overnight. There were talks for a week, five days. I had my stuff packed, I was ready. I wasn't playing for Manchester City. I wanted to play football and I wanted to come to Europe.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c33zeyy5m63o"}
