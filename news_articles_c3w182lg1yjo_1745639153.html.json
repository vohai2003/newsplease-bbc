And we didn't feel that we'd ever get out of it.\n\"We're lucky. The owner here is very supportive, so we don't have to be worried doing a long-term project like this.\n\"It is a long-term investment.\"\nAgroforestry - the process of combining agriculture and trees - has many advantages, according to the Soil Association, external.\nThe charity says planting trees, shrubs and hedges on farms can give farmers healthier soil and higher yields, as well as creating vital homes for wildlife.\nMeanwhile, below ground, tree roots can help reduce soil erosion, soak up flood water, and improve fertility through mycorrhizal fungus, external.\nFarmers also benefit from growing more than one product to sell.\n\"At those times when there is a drought and one crop doesn't come, then you've got two crops in the field that you can harvest,\" added Mrs Willoughby.\nMr Willoughby said nurturing crops and livestock alongside trees was nothing new.\n\"In the olden days there used to be sheep and pigs underneath apple trees in traditional orchards,\" he said.\n\"Apples have been grown for centuries, and they're an important crop, but we seem to have lost that in our modern farming systems.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3w182lg1yjo"}
