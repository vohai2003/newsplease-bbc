My players wanted to show that they are good players, we are a good team and there's no better place to show that than against Celtic at your home stadium. Very proud of the performance.\n\"There were a lot of good performances, starting from the striker all the way, of course, to our goalkeeper. You need in these matches to make saves and Andy Fisher made those saves.\n\"Our players, mentally, they were switched on all the time. Early goal helps because then you have even more to hang on to. Our players, they can defend.\n\"We give ourselves the fighting, fighting chance. Where it takes us? We don't know but we need to stay there until the end. We keep going.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czx481dwjweo"}
