There's no excuse, this is your duty.\n\"It's going to be a tough game. Tottenham also have lot to lose, like us. They didn't win a trophy so this is a massive chance for them. But this is not an excuse. We are Manchester United.\n\"Do you know how many fans are going to travel around the world and believe they are going to celebrate after the game because they believe in you guys?\n\"So like I said - bleed for this shirt, the history, think about your family. There is no other way than to win. Don't be selfish. It's a qualification for the Champions League.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g33z567qzo"}
