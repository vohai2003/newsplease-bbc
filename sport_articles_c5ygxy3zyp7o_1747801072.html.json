Don't make mistakes. On the back of last week we needed to be that type of team.\n\"I thought we were the better team when they had 11 men, and I thought we were professional and efficient when they went down to 10 men.\n\"There was a lot of drama but we stayed professional and stayed calm and dealt with the game. The second goal allowed us to breathe a bit easier. And they only registered their first shot on target in the dying embers of the game.\n\"It's great to get a clean sheet and a few boys back who have been out for a long time. I thought it looked a bit more like us. Just be efficient, get on with the job and get the job done.\"\nMcInnes thought Kofi Balmer's challenge \"didn't look good\", pointing out he catches Fraser Murray around the knee.\nThough he believes Dominic Thompson's sending off should have stood, and was \"more of a red card\" than Balmer's challenge.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5ygxy3zyp7o"}
