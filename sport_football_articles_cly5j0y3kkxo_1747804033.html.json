This feels like one of them for Fulham.\nThey dominated the early exchanges and hit the bar through Harry Wilson, before going 2-0 down.\nOne of those come via a terrible loose pass from Andreas Pereira and Bernd Leno also made a mistake for the goal that made it 3-1 to West Ham.\nIt is hard for Marco Silva to legislate for those kind of errors and the lack of calmness shown when Adama Traore blazed over the bar from five yards in stoppage time.\nAn eight-game unbeaten run is over but Fulham's ninth position represents a good return so far and they are still in contention for a European place.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly5j0y3kkxo"}
