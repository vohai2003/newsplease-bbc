Such a record over a 38-game season would mean them collecting 67 points, which last year would have been good enough to finish fifth and secure a place in the Europa League.\nRemarkably this was the first time since 18 December that Palace had conceded away from home in any competition, a run of seven clean sheets.\nFranca rescued a point at St Mary's, but with an FA Cup final coming up later this month, Glasner will not be too concerned about underwhelming performance.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ygm8myxvjo"}
