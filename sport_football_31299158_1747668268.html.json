I will not hide,\" he told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I made a mistake and answered back but I will never leave Forest.\"\nThe club are 12th in the Championship, 13 points off the play-offs despite Saturday's victory over Brighton under new manager Dougie Freedman.\nAl Hasawi, who took over in July 2012, added: \"I like Forest, I like the people, I like the stadium and the club. And even if I decide to leave, I will do it in the right way.\n\"I don't blame the fans. They always want what is good for the club.\n\"I feel like I am one of them and I need their support - especially at this moment. The fans need to stick together. We are with Forest in the good and the bad days, not just the good days.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31299158"}
