I think 10 days,\" said Cardiff manager Erol Bulut.\n\"We have Jak [Alnwick] so he will be good in goal for us and will handle it well\".\nAllsop is expected to miss the opening Championship games against Leeds United and QPR as well as the EFL Cup tie against Colchester United.\nMeanwhile Bulut could make further squad additions having signed midfielder Josh Bowler on loan from Nottingham Forest, alongside Aaron Ramsey, Yakou Meite, Karlan Grant, Ike Ugbo and Dimitrios Goutas.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66398648"}
