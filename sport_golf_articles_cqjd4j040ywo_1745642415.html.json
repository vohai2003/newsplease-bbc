I want to be here and just play golf. The story is what it is, but I'm just out here playing golf.\n\"From this morning when I woke up four shots behind, to chase down a win. I've never been in a final group to now being a member of the Asian Tour.\"\nHe finished one shot clear of compatriot Jack Thompson, South African Ian Snyman and Japan's Kazuki Higa.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/articles/cqjd4j040ywo"}
