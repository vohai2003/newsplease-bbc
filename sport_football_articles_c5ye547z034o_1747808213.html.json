They've played Manchester United, who from the 60th minute had 10 men. When you have that much of the ball, you need to open up teams.\n\"They've had their chances, but this is where the striker debate comes in because strikers do something out of the ordinary.\n\"Mikel Arteta has dealt with a lot of players - Aubameyang being one, who has a big ego and is a big character. But if they had him in the team there, they would have got the result.\n\"That's the difference in the striker that they need.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ye547z034o"}
