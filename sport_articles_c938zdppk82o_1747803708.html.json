The centre-back's late leveller in this one keeps momentum rolling.\nDavid Gray's back three were pulled apart throughout the opening period and it was unfolding into a sobering afternoon, but the character they have shown in recent weeks to turn their season around was on view again in a spirited comeback draw.\nThey have now won 10 points from losing positions in the Premiership this season - only Dundee United (11) and Kilmarnock (12) have recovered more.\nIn fact, it could have been better for the hosts had Dwight Gayle or Lewis Miller converted headers with the score at 2-2, the latter watching his come off a post.\nBut Gray will be more than satisfied with a draw, given the fact his team were two down in the first half before going behind again on minute 74.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c938zdppk82o"}
