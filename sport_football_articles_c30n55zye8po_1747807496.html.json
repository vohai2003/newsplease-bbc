We had the better chances and weren't able to score the second goal. In the end, we have to take the positives.\n\"It was a clear penalty. It is head-to-head but if it is another piece of the body, everybody would say it was a penalty. Joao Pedro places the ball with his head and Saliba comes to late, therefore it was a clear one.\"\nOn Joao Pedro's form: \"Joao is a key player and also one of our leaders. Today, he was our captain. Every player has bad phases in his development and we are there to help him and give him the right support and advice. I'm sure he will come back really strong.\"\nOn a strong showing after the break: \"It is a big challenge for us to play consistently with this intensity. We are [currently] only able to play [like this] in phases of the game. We have to improve and get fitter. We have to be mentally ready to play intensely for 90 minutes.\n\"If we are not able to do it, it will be difficult to win games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c30n55zye8po"}
