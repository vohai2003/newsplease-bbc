There's just one goal for us, and that's to get back into the Premier League, like we did three years ago. Just one more year and we'll be there.\n\"I hope to get my name on the start sheet, all players want to play, so of course I want to play as much as possible.\"\nThe team have been preparing under new boss Daniel Farke, who Struijk said has been \"honest\" with the players.\nHe continued: \"I feel like he's been really open and honest, a little direct but that is good and we're playing football which is the best thing for me.\n\"As a collective he wants the whole team to understand play, he also explains things to us one-on-one.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy7ypl0r5ydo"}
