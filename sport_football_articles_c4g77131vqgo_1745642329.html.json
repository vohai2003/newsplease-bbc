We have patience with her but we are already seeing early on that she can score goals and she is a threat.\n\"There is no ceiling for her in terms of improvement in the near future. We will work hard with her to make sure we get her even better. She is already in the France squad and next time [the goal] is to try and get playing time and showcase yourself.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g77131vqgo"}
