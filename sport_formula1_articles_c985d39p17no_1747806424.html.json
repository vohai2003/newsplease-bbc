It's not something that I saw coming,\" Lawson told Sky Sports.\n\"The discussions we were having weren't really leaning in this direction, so it was definitely not something that I expected.\"\nThe 23-year-old was chosen by Red Bull ahead of Tsunoda to replace Sergio Perez, who left the team at the end of the 2024 season.\nBut he started his time in the seat poorly, qualifying 18th at the opening grand prix of the season in Australia before crashing out of the race in the rain.\nIn China two weeks ago, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, before finishing the two races 14th and 12th.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c985d39p17no"}
