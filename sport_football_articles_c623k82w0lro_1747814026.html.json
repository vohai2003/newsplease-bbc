However, James could start at Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nThe club skipper's absence has left Maresca searching for alternative leaders, and he namechecked 21-year-old Colwill on Friday.\n\"I can see day by day, since we started pre-season, it's something [leadership] that he can improve. He is improving a lot,\" said the Blues boss.\n\"Even if he doesn't wear the armband, he is one of the captains. In future, he could be one of the captains for this club.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c623k82w0lro"}
