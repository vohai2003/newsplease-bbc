A regulation loss tonight followed up by a Stars win would see the last playoff spot be clinched by the Stars.\nThe Giants, are 6-4 in their last ten but are on a three game winning streak.\nA multitude of outcomes for both teams tonight in Belfast - it is sure to be spectacle.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/ice-hockey/live/c7vzv7qvg45t"}
