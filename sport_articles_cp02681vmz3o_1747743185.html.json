The champions are without Alistair Johnson and Yuki Kobayashi (both ankle), Mikey Johnston (back) and Marco Tilio, who arrived at the club with an injury.\nCounty manager Malky Mackay can pick from the same squad he had at his disposal for last weekendâ€™s Viaplay Cup game against Kelty. Ben Purrington, Jordy Hiwula and Matthew Wright are close to returning but unlikely to feature against Celtic, while Ross Callachan and Ben Paton are out with long-term knee injuries.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cp02681vmz3o"}
