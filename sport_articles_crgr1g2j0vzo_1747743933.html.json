Everyone knows he is here and hopefully we can finish the deal in the next hours'.\nAsked about the futures of Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva: \"It's not like [Ilkay] Gundogan where he finished a contract. We want them to stay because they want to stay. We will do everything possible to keep them because to replace these two players is so difficult.\"\nOn Arsenal's signings of Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and Jurrien Timber: \"They didn't buy players to make the squad bigger. They have bought starting XI players.\"\nOn trying to win a fourth trophy in 2023: \"Normally when you win the titles that we won, they give you the chance to fight for new ones. We are going to try. We finished two weeks later than Arsenal and started two weeks later. We are not in the best, best way.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crgr1g2j0vzo"}
