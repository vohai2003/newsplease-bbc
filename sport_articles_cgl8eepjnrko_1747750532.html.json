He wants us to get up the pitch and create chaos. We're enjoying it.\n\"We're going to be a side that creates a lot of chances and, as an attacking player, that's something you want to be a part of.\n\"We're understanding our roles and the positions we're playing. He has a clear idea of what he wants us to do.\n\"My main focus is doing my best to help the manager in what he wants me to do. [Last season] was a step up. Hopefully this season I can push on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgl8eepjnrko"}
