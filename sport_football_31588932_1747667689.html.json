He previously had a three-year spell at Liverpool without making a first-team appearance for the Reds.\nHe won 44 caps for France and captained them during the 2010 World Cup.\n\"He will add height, experience and, most of all, quality to the midfield,\" said Charlton head coach Guy Luzon.\n\"It's a coup for us that we can attract a player with so much international experience and I'm sure he will be fantastic for us.\"\nThe deal was completed in time for Diarra to be available to make his debut in Tuesday's game at Championship leaders Derby.\nHe is the Addicks' second signing in the space of four days after the arrival of winger Chris Eagles last week.\nDiarra made only two Premier League starts during a two-year spell at West Ham, during which he suffered a serious knee injury.\nHe has also been at Bayern Munich - again without playing a single game - as well as the likes of Lyon, Rennes, Marseille and Bordeaux.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31588932"}
