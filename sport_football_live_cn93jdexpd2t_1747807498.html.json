Sometimes you play well and don't get anything.\"\nMiquel's side will now have the chance to move up the table when they travel to Everton on Sunday, 2 February, followed by a game against Villa on 16 February.\nFor Liverpool, meanwhile, it was a fifth defeat in six league outings, as they failed to build on the 2-1 win against Brighton last week.\n\"We were just not at it in the first half and then it's tough when you're playing teams, like Leicester, that are fighting for their lives,\" Liverpool manager Beard said.\nThey have back-to-back games against West Ham coming up - an away FA Cup fourth-round tie on Wednesday followed by a home WSL meeting next weekend.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cn93jdexpd2t"}
