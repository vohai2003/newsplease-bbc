Nobody in the crowd that day expected it. It was genuinely jaw-dropping. Slot was the favourite for the job, but it hadn't been officially announced before Klopp went into song.\nIt is now becoming increasingly iconic due to the fact emerging that Slot is a phenomenal replacement - maybe even an upgrade. He has lost only one game since taking charge, a home defeat against Nottingham Forest which he continually references as something he will not let happen again. Liverpool are top of the Premier League table, have won six out of six in the Champions League and are still in both domestic cup competitions.\nNo new manager in the history of English football has had such a winning start, and remember, Slot hardly entered the transfer market, only signing an injured Federico Chiesa for this season, with the Italian barely featuring.\nSlot has massively improved Ryan Gravenberch, Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Mo Salah has always been good, but under Slot, he's the best player in the world. That day when Klopp past on the baton could signal the start of a trophy-laden era.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czd4gmvvngeo"}
