He was absolutely right.\nIn a devastating first half, they were sharper, hungrier and just simply better than St Johnstone.\nEvery time they nicked the ball or advanced forward, the scent of a goal was strong.\nLyall Cameron and Seb Palmer-Houlden often toyed with the timid home defence, and if there was a little more accuracy, it could have been many more.\nIn the second half, they completely sat back and protected their well-deserved lead.\nFor a squad short on bodies, an uneventful second 45 will have suited them nicely.\nWith Rangers and Celtic to come, these were three vital points for Dundee who remain able to look up, rather than down for now.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvgxr8nkmmko"}
