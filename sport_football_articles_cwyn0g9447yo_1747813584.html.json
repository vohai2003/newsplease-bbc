The team had just nine points, fans were fearing the worst, and relegation looked almost certain. Now, Wolves sit on the brink of a 14th-place finish with 41 points—something no one predicted just months ago.\nPereira made his mark almost straight away. Within days, Wolves picked up key results over the festive period. Suddenly, there was hope. The mood around the club shifted. The dread that used to hang over Molineux on matchdays has been replaced by genuine excitement and belief—fans now turn up thinking Wolves can beat anyone.\nKey to this revival has been Pereira's leadership style. He tackled dressing room problems with honesty and restored the discipline that was missing. He was firm when needed, taking tough decisions to move on players like Mario Lemina and Craig Dawson, ensuring the squad stayed focused and united. His open communication style, especially with the Portuguese-speaking core, made the group feel understood and valued.\nPereira's tactical clarity also made a difference. He gave players clear roles and built their confidence, simplifying what had become an overcomplicated setup under his predecessor.\nOff the pitch, he embraced the club's culture, quickly building a strong bond with the Wolves community. He never underestimated the importance of the fans, crediting their support for pushing the team through difficult moments.\nMost importantly, Pereira's calm, down-to-earth approach has inspired both players and supporters. He has brought pride and unity back to a club that felt lost before his arrival.\nAvoiding relegation and finishing mid-table when so much pointed to disaster is a huge achievement. Pereira's nomination, external is not just justified—it is a celebration of leadership that rescued a season, and gave Wolves their hope and identity back.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyn0g9447yo"}
