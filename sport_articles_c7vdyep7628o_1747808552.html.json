He can score from anywhere and is as dangerous in the fourth quarter as the first.\nThe Chiefs have not not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 18 games though, and if they can neutralise his threat they could be in business.\n...but Hurts could steal the show\nOf course, if the Chiefs put everything into stopping Barkley, that could allow Hurts the chance to reproduce his performance from his last Super Bowl - when he ran for 70 yards and three rushing touchdowns and threw for 304 yards and another score.\nIt was one of the greatest quarterback displays in Super Bowl history, but is largely forgotten thanks to his one key error and the result. With receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith truly elite, and Hurts a powerful runner, the Chiefs cannot afford to overlook him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c7vdyep7628o"}
