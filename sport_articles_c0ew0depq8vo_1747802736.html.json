I'm delighted with the reaction I got from some of the guys that came in that maybe haven't played as much recently. They added plenty.\nWe could play better in the second half. We can handle the ball better, we can pass it better, we can be far more creative and make the game easier. But, there's another team there.\n\"Today, we get the added bonus of the clean sheet.\n\"Really nice to see Ewan Wilson get his goal. The quality off the finish and composure's fantastic. [Tawanda] Maswanhise, he's that breath of fresh air out there - another you player that contributes for us today.\"\nOn the possibility of new signings this month, Kettlewell said: \"It's a possibility. I never envisaged wholesale changes but if you can pick off the correct one or two just to help the group...it's to give us more strength in depth. It's going to be gruelling, it's going to be tough. We have to ensure we have as much quality as we can get in that dressing room.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0ew0depq8vo"}
