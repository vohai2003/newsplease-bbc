Ryan Stirk cleared the ball from inside his own half which caught out the Morecambe defence and Daniel Johnson produced a neat finish to beat the onrushing Stuart Moore.\nWalsall had the better of the second half, with Johnson hitting the inside of the post from the right-hand side of the box and substitute Douglas Taylor heading over from a good position before Rawson produced the late winner.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66345825"}
