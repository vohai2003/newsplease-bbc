He’s sharp, he makes good saves and is alert in one-on-ones situations.\n\"Thomas not only brings us a really proactive level of goalkeeping but also he’s an international footballer with Belgium so he brings that level of experience too.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cd1gqryz51mo"}
