Only 3-5mm (0.1-0.2in) of rain has fallen since the start of March at a number of locations across central and southern England, with some sites experiencing their driest March since at least 1961.\nThe lack of rainfall has resulted in an increased fire risk in each of the four nations. Wildfires have been tackled by firefighters on a daily basis\nIn Northern Ireland, a major incident was declared over the weekend as a huge wildfire took hold on the Mourne Mountains.\nPeople and properties were evacuated in south-west Scotland as a wildfire spread over a large area of forest in Galloway.\nThe National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) advises against using disposable barbecues in the countryside and parks, and discarding things like cigarettes and glass bottles that can cause a fire to start.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c62ge0mv876o"}
