We always look in the mirror right, and it is just the difference between the first half and the second half. We need to do better if we want something.\n\"Obviously we are still in the top 10 but we want more, so we have to look in the mirror and do better in the first half.\n\"We were 1-0 behind Arsenal, who are a great team with big players, but we brought it back to 1-1 in the end so maybe there is a bit of happiness.\n\"The gaffer said that we need to do the full 90 minutes now. We are still a young team, if you look at the midfield and everything, so we just need to learn from every game.\n\"Hopefully, we will get there by the end of the season but it is just a process.\"\nOn the squad's youth: \"You have to be in some moments 50 or 60 times before you can be consistent at them. That is where we are working towards getting, but that is not yet.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8dqzpdzgdmo"}
