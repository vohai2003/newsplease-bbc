There is no way any council can resolve it - we can't even put a dent in it.\"\nAccording to the housing strategy document, there are more than 6,500 households in North Northamptonshire waiting for a social home â€“ a third of which had been identified as \"priority need\", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nMr Wilkes said he hoped the council's new housing strategy would help build a \"much stronger\" planning policy, giving the authority more power to instruct developers to provide what was needed in the area.\nJason Smithers, Conservative leader of NNC, said: \"As with many local authorities, the current demand for social housing outstrips the supply of council-registered properties available for rent.\n\"The council is committed to regular reviews of the housing register to ensure it is up to date and reflective of current housing need.\n\"Our Keyways team remains dedicated to assessing new housing applications as expediently as possible.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg11g5dwwdo"}
