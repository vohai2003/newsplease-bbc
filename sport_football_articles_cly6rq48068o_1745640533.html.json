It is a blessing to come here, so I'm happy. I like to say I'm a bit of a poacher. I was trying to smell where the ball would go and I reacted first, put my head on it and it was in the back of the net.\n\"They are a very good team, with a lot of talent. We tried to take the sting out of the game and control possession. They had their chances and sometimes a game goes down to penalties. We had a bit of fortune with the penalties with Leno saving two.\n\"I am proud of every single player. We are buzzing and we take each game as it comes. That's the best way to take each game - don't get too down with the losses and don't let the wins get to your head.\"\nOn goalkeeper Bernd Leno: \"He has been amazing. He has kept us in games so many times. He deserves the recognition.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cly6rq48068o"}
