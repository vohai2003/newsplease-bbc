He came into Formula One and many people were doubting him but he has developed himself.\n\"He had a decent season last year and I think he is a very competitive driver.\"\nLawson's demotion means he will be racing for Red Bull's junior team Racing Bulls this weekend.\nThe 23-year-old New Zealander is certainly not the first to have experienced this at Red Bull, with the team having developed a reputation for being great for giving young talent a chance, but ruthless with a driver if they feel it isn't working out.\nIn 2016, Daniil Kvyat was dropped after two high-profile crashes with Sebastian Vettel at the Russian Grand Prix - the fourth race of the season.\nCurrent world champion Max Verstappen, who was 18 at the time, was promoted to replace Kvyat and the Dutchman made an instant impression as he won the Spanish Grand Prix - his first race for Red Bull and one that made him the youngest winner in F1 history.\nVerstappen went on to dominate the sport while Kvyat's Formula 1 career never really recovered. He had a couple of seasons with Toro Rosso and AlphaTauri but has raced in different series' since 2022.\nSergio Perez was Verstappen's team-mate last season but endured a difficult run of form as he struggled with the RB20 and he was dropped by Red Bull at the end of the year.\n\"When I joined Red Bull, there had been great drivers who had struggled - Alex [Albon], Pierre [Gasly], they are fantastic drivers and they struggled,\" Perez told F1.com, external\n\"For me, it was very simple, the car is just quite difficult to get 100% out of it, to get the confidence out of it - and the things I struggled with, even Adrian [Newey, the team's former design chief] talked about them.\"\nAlguersuari knows all too well how tough the sport can be with all the pressure to perform, particularly at Red Bull.\nHe spent three seasons in F1 from 2009, mainly racing for Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso, where he scored 25 of the team's 40 points in 2011 but lost his drive there at the end of that season.\n\"Red Bull has the ability to make you feel outside of your comfort zone, to make you doubt yourself,\" Alguersuari added.\n\"Red Bull is a machine of destroying drivers because they have this mentality and philosophy of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. So they always push and put pressure on you.\n\"Even at Toro Rosso they asked me to win a race or otherwise it was not good enough. You had this feeling of not being good enough all the time unless you are world champion.\"\nThere's no doubt it is tough to take for the driver who has been demoted.\nLawson reacted to the news on social media by posting a picture of himself as a child and a drawing he made of becoming an F1 driver.\n\"Being a Red Bull Racing driver has been my dream since I was a kid, it's what I've worked towards my whole life,\" he wrote.\n\"It's tough, but I'm grateful for everything that's brought me to this point.\"\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said everything would be done to ensure Lawson has the support he needs.\n\"We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and together,\" he said.\n\"We see that after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with ... Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cn80g5jzv02o"}
