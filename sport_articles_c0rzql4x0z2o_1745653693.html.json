Some big decisions went against us. At 1-1 we score what we think is a very good goal.\n\"It gets chalked off for a handball. It takes about 3-4 minutes for the VAR guys to decide it hits his hand. Prior to Hibs scoring their second goal we should have had a corner.\n\"It was clear and obvious from where I was standing that the spin on the ball shows Lewis Fiorini had kicked the ball off a Hibs player. So we should've had a corner and the chance to go and get that second goal. A goal kick was given. We should defend the situation better, but it [the decision] leads to the goal.\n\"The big talking point is the handball. I've watched it from six or seven different angles and I can't for the life of me see where it hits his hand.\n\"If I'm wrong I'll certainly apologise, but from what I've seen a perfectly good goal has been disallowed.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c0rzql4x0z2o"}
