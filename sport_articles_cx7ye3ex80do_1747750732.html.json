You have to organise much more.\n\"Trent can play the position - it depends on who is on the left and right of him.\n\"We really thought it was a very good and important thing to do this pre-season.\n\"We still want to try it with Trent as a right-back again. Then we'll see how we'll start the season.\"\nLiverpool continue preparations for the new season when they take on Leicester City at Singapore National Stadium on Sunday (10:00 BST kick-off).\nThey then complete their tour of the Far East with a friendly against Bayern Munich at the same venue on Wednesday (12:30).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx7ye3ex80do"}
