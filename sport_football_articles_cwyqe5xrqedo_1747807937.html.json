Nuno clearly has a high regard for the FA Cup and perhaps also a sense of unfinished business after his Wolves side lost to Watford in the 2019 semi-final.\nNow set to face Manchester City, Forest's second trip to Wembley in three years harks back to the Clough era when trips down the M1 were a regular occurrence. Playing the Premier League champions and last year's runners-up, despite their toils this season, will of course be a huge occasion for a fanbase starved of success.\nWith two big matches this week against Manchester United and Aston Villa, the Reds' season is still very much alive on two fronts. And while it will not be easy, we can only hope Forest do not make it difficult for themselves - there are enough challenges as it is.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyqe5xrqedo"}
