Unfortunately I couldn't.\"\nOn combining with fellow substitute Konstantinos Tsimikas for the goal: \"We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he [Tsimikas] passed it to me and so when we were on the touchline we said: 'Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner' - and it was a goal.\n\"It was one of those occasions where everything went right. But like I said, I am not happy because I think we could have won.\"\nOn Matz Sels' performance: \"I was just telling that to my former coaches from Wolves just now. He made two or three great saves. You want to do better but he was good as well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdryd1ejedjo"}
