A key element of a resolution with any club would be Rashford's wages - he is one of United's highest earners, with a salary in excess of Â£300,000 a week.\nAt a time of wider cost-cutting, senior United executives realise the importance of limiting the amount they will have to pay to subsidise any transfer, either on loan or permanent.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2pe137egqo"}
