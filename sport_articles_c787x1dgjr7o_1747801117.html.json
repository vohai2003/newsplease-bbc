We have three or four really good gilt-edged chances that we miss.\n\"There's a lot of good in it but the end product was poor all over the pitch. If your end product's poor and you make individual errors, which we did, we get punished for, then you lose football matches.\n\"The disappointment is the consistency, we haven't followed a great result up anytime this season. I can't ever fault the effort, I can't ever fault the desire of the players, we just lacked quality in that final third.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c787x1dgjr7o"}
