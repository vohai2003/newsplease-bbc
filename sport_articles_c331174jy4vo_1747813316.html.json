He did a good job there and I think he'd be an ideal replacement and it's not too much of a risk. He knows the league and the players in it, so I think it would hopefully be a smooth transition.\nJohn: Either Paul Lambert or David Martindale. I think both managers could improve our style of football, giving better entertainment for the fans. Passing, flowing football has been seriously lacking this season and at times it has been a grim watch.\nJay: Shaun Maloney for Killie - that'd be a great shout.\nGary: Scott Brown with a bigger and better squad than he has at Ayr could do well. Docherty unfairly sacked as Dundee boss. Chris Burke on coaching staff.\nMatthew: Robbie Neilson. Average 1.7 points per game, likes to play 3-4-2-1 which allows you to play a more progressive, entertaining football.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c331174jy4vo"}
