In March we only play one Premier League game, then we have the cup final of course and an international break and then two big games against Paris Saint-Germain - so we are not focused on the long term.\n\"I know and the players know how difficult the Champions League game is going to be - they are in the same form as us, hardly lose. It is going to be a difficult task for both teams.\n\"Now the players have some days off and then we focus on PSG more than we do on the table in the Premier League.\"\nOn rest for the players: \"Yes it is true that rest is good but also I would love to play because the likes of [Harvey] Elliot, [Jarell] Quansah, [Federico] Chiesa would have been good for them to have a game, but for Virgil [Van Dijk] and Mo [Salah] and these players it is very good.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c8e77re8xy2o"}
