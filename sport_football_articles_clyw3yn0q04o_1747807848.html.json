I just needed to patiently wait and got my opportunity.\"\nThe change came as a surprise for many but boss Danny Rohl dismissed the idea Beadle had lost his spot in goal - though he did affirm Wednesday fans can expect to see more of Charles in his place.\n\"In every position, we have competition. It's normal,\" Rohl said.\n\"There is not one number one, we have two number ones now and they fight every week.\n\"They challenge each other and I think for us, it's also good to see how ready Pierce is. On the other side, James is also doing well.\n\"Both get the same chances.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyw3yn0q04o"}
