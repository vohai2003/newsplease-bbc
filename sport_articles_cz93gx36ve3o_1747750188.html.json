We don't need to sell, we're not in the [financial] position we were in last year.\n\"Ryan's done terrifically well. He's a very, very good footballer if he doesn't complicate the game.\"\nRegarding incomings, Robinson added that he wants to bring in a \"strong, physical striker\" and \"another left-back to challenge Scott [Tanser].\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz93gx36ve3o"}
