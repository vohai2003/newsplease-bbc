Bishop finishing well when he was just offside summed up his luck at the moment.\nBishop isn't his clinical self but his build-up play remains excellent. Josh Murphy put in another outstanding performance - he must be one of the division's form wingers.\n\"Keep playing like that and they'll have no problem staying up\" feels an easy thing to say. Consistency has been an issue for Portsmouth this season though so the question is can they repeat efforts like that.\nA similar performance against Cardiff on Tuesday would be very handy.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxkq0vwd7ro"}
