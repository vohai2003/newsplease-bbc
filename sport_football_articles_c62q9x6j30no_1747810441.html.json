I'm looking forward to getting the head down in training, getting sharper and hopefully getting some minutes when the Gaffer calls on me.\"\nPanayiotou's international clearance will not come through in time for Tuesday's BetMcLean Cup semi-final against Cliftonville but he will be available to face Glentoran in the Premiership on Saturday.\n\"I have previously worked with Harrison for a short period of time in the past and I know what he will be able to bring to our group in terms of experience, having played at similar levels in England and Scotland, alongside other leagues in Europe,\" said Rooney.\n\"As a player, he possesses good hold-up play for a centre-forward, while also being able to lead the line in terms of pressing really well with an ability to mix up his movements in the box which is something that is vital that our forward line continues to do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62q9x6j30no"}
