Barry Robson showed what he is capable of last season and they have recruited well. I think it may take time for Hearts to settle with their new management set-up.\nKenny Miller: It will be between Hearts and Aberdeen again. Barry Robson did a brilliant job when he took over last season, but I think Hearts will maybe just nick it this time. Hearts have got a strong team and Aberdeen will have to find a way of dealing with European football.\nLeanne Crichton: Aberdeen have got good stability too, keeping Graeme Shinnie and Leighton Clarkson is important. I fancy Hearts to go well, but Aberdeen will edge it.\nStephen Craigan: Aberdeen jump to mind, but I'm wary that they have eight extra games in Europe between now and Christmas. I worry about their strength in depth. I'm not so sure Hearts will make it much further in Europe, so I'll go with them finishing above Aberdeen.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cv2nlg8ql9jo"}
