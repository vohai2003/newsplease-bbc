The budget also contains 157 savings in services including youth clubs and support for elderly and vulnerable people.\n\"The local authority cannot continue to cover and do everything, and we cannot continue to offer gold-plated services,\" said Conservative leader Patrick Harley.\nThe budget was passed on Monday night and was part of the council's five-year strategy to save £42m.\nThe council had to make tough decisions to avoid any risk of effective bankruptcy and commissioners taking over, Harley said.\n\"If we don't cut our cloth accordingly, then we won't be able to make these decisions [ourselves], as hard as they are. I will not be making them – a commissioner will,\" he told BBC Radio WM.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crew8ylyneqo"}
