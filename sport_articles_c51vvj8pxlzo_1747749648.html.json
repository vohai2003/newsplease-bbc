It's just a matter of time for him to understand our principles and ideas on and off the ball.\n\"Raul is more experienced and you can see how is going to help the team.\n\"He made an impact that I wanted to see, linking our game, holding the ball and some good movements inside the box.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c51vvj8pxlzo"}
