Unfortunately for Dom [Calvert-Lewin], [Orel] Mangala, Dwight [McNeil], I want to say this victory is for them. We are happy to give them this joy.\n\"I was just running free and saw the space. My team-mates know me, I like to run behind. They know. I knew it was the best moment for me.\n\"It wasn't easy, but we made it easy. We knew we needed to win this game. They want to come here to beat us because we are fighting for the place [they want]. I'm really happy for the boys.\n\"We just need to keep working and keep improving. We have a lot to improve, I have a lot to improve. We need to keep going.\n\"We can handle the criticism. We will work for next week to beat Bournemouth.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdxe4vvwr1wo"}
