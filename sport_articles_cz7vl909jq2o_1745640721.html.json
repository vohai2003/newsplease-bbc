The manager persevered and is now seeing the benefits.\nThe majority of the credit must go to the player himself. He has never shied away from the challenges of breaking into a side with talents such as Nicolas Kuhn, James Forrest, Maeda and now Jota occupying the wide areas.\nCrucially he also has the backing of his team-mates and that could be seen clearly in how they celebrated with him on Saturday night.\nSpeaking after Yang's 26-minute man-of-the-match display against St Mirren, Arne Engels said: \"It was just unbelievable. I'm really happy for him. Yang is always training at 100%. A really amazing performance from him.\"\nThe key, however, at Celtic isn't what you did in the last game, it's what you'll do in the next one, and that now means Sunday's Scottish Cup quarter-final with Hibs.\nIf Yang can add to those 10 goal contributions this weekend, and follow it up against Rangers the following week, we may well be looking at the latest rising star in this increasingly exciting team that Rodgers is building.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cz7vl909jq2o"}
