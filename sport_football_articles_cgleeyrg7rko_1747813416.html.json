We left Manchester at 22:30 [Monday night] and met at the local pub and then left there at quarter to three in the morning [on Tuesday].\n\"We're now outside London heading to Dover, [from there] to Calais on the ferry, from Calais a nearly nine-hour coach ride to Bordeaux and we'll stay overnight, and then travel from Bordeaux to Bilbao in the morning for another four hours.\n\"Bordeaux do nice wine and it's a lot cheaper. It's cost about £350 to come on the coach whereas the flights were £900, so we've done OK It's just a long journey.\n\"But the coach is very quiet and it's quite nice.
