I thought the Hammers' displays were picking up, but then they got absolutely demolished by Liverpool.\nSo, this feels like a good time for Manchester City to play them as they look to build on their win at Leicester.\nThat was not a particularly pretty performance but that part does not matter for Pep Guardiola's side at the moment.\nIt is all about taking small steps for City as they try to find some form again, so it was important for them to see Erling Haaland back on the scoresheet against the Foxes, and to keep their first clean sheet in five games.\nThis game might be a similar story in that City will have to scrap a bit, but again I expect them to get the job done.\nMcCabe's prediction: 3-0\nWe played West Ham the other day, and they weren't very good.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg9lywxnlwo"}
