He offers so much, causes confusion for opponents, brings confidence to his team-mates and direction in attack.\nBoth sides of course had already clinched a top-four spot but it felt like they were there to leave a mark.\nWhile the result did not go much-changed Warriors' way, the manner of defeat is weirdly one to be confident about. Seb Stephen, 19, at hooker put in a tremendous shift and is definitely one to be excited about for the future.\nA two-week break may now allow some players to return from injury before the home knockout game against the Stormers.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cd900xyppx5o"}
