Callacher then came closest to breaking the deadlock late in the second half, but his header struck the crossbar and went behind.\nLinfield had the ball in the net on the stroke of half-time but Fitzpatrick was deemed to have been in an offside position as he interfered with play right on the goal line.\nThe Blues almost found the first goal of the evening early in the second half, as Fitzpatrick couldn't direct Ben Hall's flick-on on target, despite being just a yard from goal.\nLinfield exerted control in the second half, and were rewarded as Orr rose highest to meet Kyle McClean's cross to break the deadlock, with his looping header beating Jonny Tuffey.\nFitzpatrick made it 2-0 when his right-foot strike from just inside the box sneaked in at the nearpost.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c3w1dn7wn5gt"}
