It ended up 4-3 to Chelsea earlier in the season, and there are likely to be a few more goals this time too.\nChelsea have people like Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke back from injury to bolster their attack, but Spurs have got some key players like Micky van de Ven fit again too.\nTottenham's league campaign has been disappointing - it is winning the Europa League or bust for them - while Chelsea are still chasing the Champions League places.\nSpurs looked tired to me before the international break, so it will be interesting to see what they are like here. We know how exciting they can be on their day, it is just those days have been few and far between this season.\nChelsea have been a bit flat as well, but maybe this is the game where both teams come to life and serve up a thriller - that is what I am hoping for anyway.\nSutton's prediction: 3-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gr5ldge0zo"}
