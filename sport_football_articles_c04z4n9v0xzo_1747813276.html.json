The lad has been incredible every time he's played for us. He's already given fans some huge moments - that crunching tackle on Mbappe for one - and he has earned his spot. We only need to buy a good back-up at this point.\nAdrian: You need to have two top players in every position. Bradley can definitely be one of those but we do need another - I'd go for Frimpong.\nMaritn: Tino Livramento is the obvious candidate to bring in to compete with Bradley for the right back berth. He has had premier league experience with Newcastle.\nJamie: Conor Bradley easily has the capability to take over from Trent. I'd much rather us use our money this window on a striker and to replace Salah or Van Dijk if no contract is agreed. But definitely look to sign a young full-back to back up Bradley.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c04z4n9v0xzo"}
