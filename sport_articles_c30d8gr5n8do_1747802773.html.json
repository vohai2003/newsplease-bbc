But I guess, after all, I was just a girl with a dream and a fan that got lucky.\n\"I wish nothing but success for everyone involved with Celtic. Once a Celt, always a Celt.\"\nHead-coach Elena Sadiku praised Hayes' contribution, saying: \"I want to thank Caitlin for everything she has done for the club,.\n\"Especially since I have come to Glasgow, she has been very important for the team on the pitch. She has been a great character.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c30d8gr5n8do"}
