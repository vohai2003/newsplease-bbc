When PSG got that first goal, you just knew [they would go on to win the game]. It was just chance after chance. PSG ran riot.\n\"City's confidence has been dented. You can't just walk into the supermarket and buy confidence off the shelf.\n\"They are not quite there physically either, but I think that is down to the confidence. Once you get that sinking feeling, it is going to fall apart. It is difficult for the team and difficult for the manager - and it is a tough moment.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg9v75y06po"}
