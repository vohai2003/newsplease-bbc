Even the local Boscombe Silver Band's numbers had suspiciously swelled, performing before kick-off at each cup tie.\nThen FA Cup regulations said that in the event of a colour clash, both teams must change - so Bournemouth wore all-white and United blue, but the fairytale run ended that day.\nWith no substitutes, an early collision between United defender Mark Jones and Cherries inside-right Ollie Norris left both players as passengers for the rest of the game.\n\"Gallant little Bournemouth,\" as the surviving Pathe newsreel footage , externalcalls them, took a shock first-half lead when Nelson Stiffle's corner was nodded in by Brian Bedford.\nBut United. with England star Duncan Edwards pulling the strings, hit back when the ball was played through to Johnny Berry and with Bournemouth appealing for offside, he slid the ball past keeper Tommy Godwin to equalise.\nReferee Frank Coultas waved away the Cherries protests, and later adjudged that Joe Brown had handled Dennis Viollet's shot, with the Bournemouth left-half claiming the ball had struck his shoulder.\n\"We wore all-white that day and the ball's impact could clearly be seen on Joe's chest,\" Bedford recalled. \"It was never a penalty and one or two of their players said as much afterwards.\"\nBerry hammered home the resulting spot-kick, and the dream was over for Cox's \"Pippins\", though they were awarded the Sunday Pictorial newspaper's \"Giant-Killers' Cup\".\nUnited made it all the way to the final, losing 2-1 to Aston Villa, and Busby later wrote in his book My Story that of all their Cup ties that season, \"our finest hour was seen on the Dean Court ground at Bournemouth\".\nEleven months later, six of the United XI who faced the Cherries - Edwards, Jones, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Billy Whelan and David Pegg - were among those who lost their lives in the Munich air disaster, while Berry was so badly injured he never played again.\nTime for Andoni Iraola's side to write a new chapter in Bournemouth's history?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62kpg26wnvo"}
