We were delighted [to win the Shield] but it comes with the territory. It was an amazing night and seeing the supporters, a lot of supporters haven't seen Glentoran lift a trophy in a long time.\n\"Some of the players were playing in their first final and collecting their first winners' medal. A lot of young players there, three or four players that have come through the academy.\"\nIn addition to collecting the Shield during January, the Glens progressed through two rounds of the Irish Cup, including a dramatic last-16 win over Belfast 'Big Two' rivals Linfield, won two BetMcLean Cup ties to reach the March final and took a win and a draw from the two league matches they played.\n\"It's been frantic to say the least. We've had a lot of high intensity games and difficult games,\" said Devine.\n\"Between the players and the backroom team they have all worked so hard to get through a really difficult period â€“ winning a trophy and still going unbeaten. It's testimony to the group.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdd9q758966o"}
