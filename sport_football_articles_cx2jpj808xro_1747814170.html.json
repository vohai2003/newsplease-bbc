The objective was to try and win today and secure our spot in the top eight. I thought the boys were good, controlled the game and we were never really threatened. We had to bide our time as they sat deep, but they gave that up in the end to chase the game and the goals came.\n\"[The victory was] made in Tottenham tonight. I'm super pleased for the young boys, and we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we had a couple more teenagers out there too. I'm sure those three lads won't sleep tonight. We needed something tonight and the young lads stepped up.\n\"We've got another big week coming up so the changes at half time were about managing the load. We still picked up injury with Radu [Dragusin] which is not great, but the three lads at half time are good.\"\nOn Dragusin's injury: \"It is too early to say what it is, we will need to investigate futher. But it was his knee which is not good.\n\"We have another game on Sunday. The club will be working hard behind the scenes to see if we can get something done.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2jpj808xro"}
