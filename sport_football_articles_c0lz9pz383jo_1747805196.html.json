Good for them,\" Miquel said.\nHowever, Miquel recognised that Girma's hefty price tag could be a lesson that encourages other clubs to invest heavily in players to avoid being left behind.\n\"It's not ideal but it can also maybe give the other clubs intention to try and build the same thing,\" Miquel added.\nEx-England striker Ellen White added: \"Every team in the WSL needs to think 'do we want to be on this train or not?' because otherwise Chelsea will be running away with this for years.\"\nMeanwhile, Manchester United boss Marc Skinner said the world-record fee showed how far women's football has grown.\n\"I wasn't old enough to be able to remember the first million pounds men's transfer but it shows a significant growth and for me, someone who's been in the women's game for 20-plus years now, it's a great sign of growth,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0lz9pz383jo"}
