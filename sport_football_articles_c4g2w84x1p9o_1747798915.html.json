We played against a very good side but the game was there, we needed a killer instinct to get the goals. When you play against Manchester City, you know they will have a lot of the ball. The killer instinct was missing but we created a lot of chances.\n\"We have to carry on. Not just for the rest of the season but everything that comes after.\"\nOn his responsibility to be the difference: \"We know that I will get more attention than others because I am the captain and I need to be at a level every time I go on the pitch. Effort will never be missing and that has to be my main thing to show to the other players.\"\nOn how far off Manchester United are: \"It is not these games that will define that. Whenever we play big teams, we know the pressure and attention is there. If we want to be a big club like Manchester City and Liverpool, we have to do that consistently. If after today we relax and think that this is enough, we go back again. We have to do this consistently.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g2w84x1p9o"}
