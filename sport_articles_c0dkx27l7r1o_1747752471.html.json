Thatâ€™s good, it gives him a couple of weeks to get some training and game time to be available for the start of the season. He is working hard, doing long days. He is as keen to be back as we are for him to be with us.\"\nForest's first league fixture sees them face Arsenal on Saturday 12 August.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0dkx27l7r1o"}
