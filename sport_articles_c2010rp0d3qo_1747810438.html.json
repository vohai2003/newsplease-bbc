We felt that the goals were there and it was just going to click and thankfully today it did click and that performance with the goals we managed to score is very, very pleasing.\n\"We'll enjoy tonight, we'll make sure everybody's ready to go next week and we'll concentrate fully on Dundee.\n\"We concentrate on that game, go and hopefully get the result there and then after that we look at what the next steps are.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2010rp0d3qo"}
