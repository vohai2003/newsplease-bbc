Nuno Espirito Santo was clearly unhappy with some of his side's defending in that game.\nBut how are Arsenal going to score goals? I don't know at the moment.\nIf Gunners boss Mikel Arteta needs a left-back, he has got a few of them on the bench. Unfortunately he needs a centre-forward, and there is not one of those to be seen.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp8yq1jn391o"}
