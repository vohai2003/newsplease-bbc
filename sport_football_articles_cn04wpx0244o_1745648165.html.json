They are an incredibly solid team.\n\"We created a lot and conceded little - the basics we have done for many years. We are happy to reach the quarter-finals and we are happy with the way we played.\n\"How many times in the last few years have we reached the semi-finals? When you arrive six times in a row to the semi-finals, it is because the FA Cup is important. When you play in this competition and you behave like the way we behave, I'm so proud â€“ I love it. It shows how honest we are - and I like that.\n\"We are one game away from Wembley and we'll see what happens.\"\nOn Nico O'Reilly's performance: \"He is not a typical academy player. He is a physical presence. He is a number 10, I would say. He can play in a few positions and he is a threat from set-pieces because he is strong. I'm really pleased for him because he helped us a lot.\"\nOn Plymouth's performance: \"Defensively, they were incredibly well organised. They didn't press much and defended a little deeper, but they defended with solidarity. That's why I said I didn't take anything for granted.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cn04wpx0244o"}
