It's not just because it is Liverpool, but because we needed to bounce back after the last two games.\n\"Our first half was very, very good. We played at a very high level. We showed great organisation and commitment. We were clearly the best team on the pitch in the first half.\n\"In the second half, there was a good reaction from Liverpool, which we expected, and our energy went down a little bit which was to be expected because it was so high in the first half. Overall though, we deserved the three points.\"\nOn Rodrigo Muniz's goal: \"He is a proper quality striker. He is still very young but he is growing so quick. There are still many things to improve, but he is very high quality for a number nine.\"\nOn Calvin Bassey: \"Calvin has all the skills to be a top central defender. He ticks all the boxes to be a top, top player. Now he has to be more consistent.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3ev1w11539o"}
