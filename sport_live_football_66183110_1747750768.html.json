A point against Morocco in their final group game will seal top spot.\nGermany are second on three points, level with Morocco. The Germans will be favourites to qualify, with their final game coming against South Korea, who have yet to win a point.\nThose games will both be on Thursday at 11:00 BST.\nPost\nGermany 1-2 Colombia\nKatie Smith\nBBC reporter at Sydney Football Stadium\nThe Colombian players begin a lap of honour here in Sydney.
