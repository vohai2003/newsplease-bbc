The first goal was a corner in the second-phase shot. The second goal, we lost the ball ourselves in a place where we shouldn't.\n\"Overall, we controlled the game and didn't give big chances away. That is why it is disappointing we didn't take anything from this game.\n\"It was a difficult one, but we have to make sure we get these performances and convert them into points as well.\n\"We knew from last week against Manchester City that we were in the game and pushing for points. In that sense, if we can maintain the level then we should convert it into points.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gpqq2mr70o"}
