We had lots of control in the first 40 minutes, then we give away a needless goal from a counter attack.\n\"We concede and that gives them impetus heading into the second half. We go in front but give away two really disappointing goals that we should deal with.\n\"I give credit to the players, they kept going. But for our standard, that second half has to be better.\n\"We were too passive. Too slow. With the ball, just not aggressive enough.\n\"Tonight was about doing the basics of the game well and we did not do that well enough.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cly7dlvl27zo"}
