Out of possession we need to be really defensively organised, but we need to make sure that particularly at home that we carry that goal threat.\n\"I thought we got that right against Rangers and it will be challenging but we need to endeavour to do the same thing against Celtic.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c391nvnpgl2o"}
