We did some mistakes in defence and it was enough to lose the game.\n\"I think we dominated the game, created lots of chances but we didn't score. There were some really good moments in the game, but some bad moments in defence.\n\"I saw really a lot of players playing at a good level. I think we were just not clinical despite dominating a lot. We really were not good in the last 20 metres [of the pitch].\n\"I'm disappointed we didn't win. It is a great competition and opportunity for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwypdj7zlpro"}
