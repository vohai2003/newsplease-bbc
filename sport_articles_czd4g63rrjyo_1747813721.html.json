They are honest players who are not making excuses about the situation.\n\"They are not feeling sorry for themselves. They are suffering.\n\"Are they at 100 per cent maximum confidence? Of course not, because they are losing football matches.\n\"But at the same time, we are a football team and sometimes you lose, and in those moments you need to show what you are. This is kind of our moment. We need to show what kind of team we are.\n\"We need to be ready for our next match at home. That is the opportunity when it all starts, the climbing of the table.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czd4g63rrjyo"}
