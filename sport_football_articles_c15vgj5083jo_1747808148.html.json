United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how.\nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957.\nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their Â£40m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c15vgj5083jo"}
