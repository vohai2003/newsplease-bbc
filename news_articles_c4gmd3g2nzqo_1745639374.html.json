China quickly retaliated imposing 10-15% tariffs on US farm products.\n\"If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,\" China's embassy said on X, reposting a line from a government statement on Tuesday.\nIt is some of the strongest rhetoric so far from China since Trump became president and comes as leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual National People's Congress.\nOn Wednesday, China's Premier Li Qiang announced that China would again boost its defence spending by 7.2% this year and warned that \"changes unseen in a century were unfolding across the world at a faster pace.\" This increase was expected and matches the figure announced last year.\nLeaders in Beijing are trying to send a message to people in China that they are confident the country's economy can grow, even with the threat of a trade war.\nChina has been keen to portray an image of being a stable, peaceful country in contrast to the US, which Beijing accuses of being embroiled in wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.\nChina may also hope to capitalise on Trump's actions relating to US allies such as Canada and Mexico, which have also been hit by tariffs, and will not want to ramp up the rhetoric too far to scare off potential new global partners.\nThe Premier's speech in Beijing on Wednesday emphasised that China would continue to open up and hoped to attract more foreign investment.\nChina has, in the past emphasised that it is ready to go to war. Last October, President Xi called for troops to strengthen their preparedness for war as they held military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan. But there is a difference between military preparedness and a readiness to go to war.\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington's post quoted a foreign ministry statement in English from the previous day, which also accused the US of blaming China for the influx of the drug fentanyl\n\"The fentanyl issue is a flimsy excuse to raise US tariffs on Chinese imports,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson said.\n\"Intimidation does not scare us. Bullying does not work on us. Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China,\" he added.\nThe US-China relationship is always one of the most contentious in the world. This post on X has been widely shared and could be used by the China hawks in Trump's cabinet as evidence that Beijing is Washington's biggest foreign policy and economic threat.\nOfficials in Beijing had been hopeful that USâ€“China relations under Trump could get off to a more cordial start after he invited Xi to his inauguration. Trump also said the two leaders had \"a great phone call\" just a few days before he entered the White House.\nThere were reports that the two leaders were due to have another call last month. That did not happen.\nXi had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment.\nChina has pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy and its leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors.\nChina has the world's second-largest military budget at $245bn but it is far smaller than that of the US. Beijing spends 1.6% of GDP on its military, far less than the US or Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\nHowever, analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gmd3g2nzqo"}
