It is also a big task.\nLiverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are certainly not going away. But Newcastle and Aston Villa are progressing and will spend - if they can - in the summer. And that is without talking about Nottingham Forest, Brighton and the other sides who have been too good for United this season.\nUnited might win the derby at Old Trafford, or they might not. But there is a bigger picture. And Amorim knows what it is.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c74zxwpv2keo"}
