Nottingham are really good on the transition and it was a goal from nothing.\n\"Suffering the first goal in this way puts the opponent in the position they want to be in, defending with a lot of men and making the transitions. During the game we lacked a bit of quality in the final third which is important when you are trying to win games. We deserved more.\"\nOn the Forest goal: \"We have men to block and a whole pitch to run in which to make a foul. We have to make better decisions.\"\nOn introducing Harry Maguire as a substitute: \"If you look at the game in the final 15 minutes they were defending with six men in the box so we had to get more players in there. We cannot get inside the box with the combinations.\n\"Harry Maguire is really strong on set pieces and when you are in the opposite box you are a striker not a defender. He is maybe the best guy to play inside the box.\"\nOn the Manchester derby on Sunday: \"If you look at the game we are improving the way we play football, we are creating chances and dominating the games more.\n\"We know that this season is going to be like that, win momentum, lose momentum. We continue going into the next match.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn8vjeexx59o"}
