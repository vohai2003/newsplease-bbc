Two passes and one lightning counter attack later, through Ilia Gruev and Piroe, James had the ball again.\nHis finish this time, high inside Selvik's left hand post, was emphatic.\nWatford saw enough of the ball to believe they were still in it but on 35 minutes two became three - Manor Solomon receiving the ball from a throw in, cutting inside and firing home via a wicked deflection off the heel of Mattie Pollock which left Selvik no chance.\nLeeds were not done, adding a fourth just after the hour mark, Ao Tanaka combining with Piroe, whose dazzling close control put Pollock on his backside and whose left-foot finish proved too good for Selvik.\nIt was a 14th league goal of an increasingly impressive season for the striker.\nWith Leeds cutting loose with their full repertoire of attacking skills, James went close to bagging his hat-trick, pushing a shot from distance just wide after a flowing move.\nYet, with Leeds relaxing, the home side never gave up the fight and might have grabbed a consolation, Giorgi Chakvetadze hitting the bar and Imran Louza forcing a fine save from Illan Meslier three minutes from time.\nWatford manager Tom Cleverley speaking to BBC Three Counties Radio:\n\"A tough night? Absolutely. We were in the presence of a very strong Championship side. I think we knew that before but it is one of the best teams I have seen at this level.\n\"It should give us inspiration that they are the levels we want to get to. I feel like all my players have got the potential to reach that level but it doesn't just happen so I challenge the players to be more intense in their work in the week, more professional wherever they can â€“ and I am not saying any of them are unprofessional. You can always do more.\n\"But there were some positives with the character we showed to try and play so I cannot criticise my players. It would have been easy to chuck the towel in or start looking towards Saturday and protecting yourself when the game is done but they kept going.\"\nLeeds manager Daniel Farke speaking to BBC Radio Leeds:\n\"We started on the front foot with good chances but I have to say that Watford also had good situations in the first 10 minutes. They are a good side who are dangerous on the counter-attack so it was important for us to score the first goal.\n\"I'm not sure the 4-0 reflects how difficult this game was because I really like how Tom [Cleverley] sets up his team. I think he is doing an excellent job here and it was difficult to take possession away from them.\n\"I predict not many teams will leave here with three points so I am pretty happy with the win and the scoreline and clean sheet.\n\"But we were really excellent in executing our counter-attacks and the fourth goal was poetry in motion. You would have to say the individual performance of the players up front was of a top level.\n\"If we perform like this our offensive row is unplayable at times.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c2472zz3nq3t"}
