It's probably a bit high given he had a year left on his contract, but relative to what the Saudis have spent on Fabinho from Liverpool or (Sadio) Mane from Bayern Munich it doesn't seem in anyway outside of the market that the Saudis have created.\"\nThe Premier League has \"robust\" rules in place to ensure sales made between clubs owned by the same entity are of \"fair market value\", however Crafton believes there is the potential to bypass this with loan deals.\nHe added: \"I think one of the looming issues is if in January Bruno Guimaraes has an injury and all of a sudden Ruben Neves rocks up to Newcastle on loan for six months - I think that's the sort of thing the Premier League would struggle with.\n\"From a regulatory point of view, I don't think there's regulations there to stop that. I also think other clubs in the league would kick up a big fuss about that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ce9kdqyny3do"}
