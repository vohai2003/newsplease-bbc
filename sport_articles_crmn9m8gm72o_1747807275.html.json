He can play a number of positions but he's really made that midfield a position of his own.\n\"He was up all night, would you believe, with a similar type of bug to Babunski.\n\"He was really feeling under the weather prior to the game but testament to him and his character, he was able to get through it.\n\"He'll need plenty of recovery and hopefully he'll be OK for the game on Sunday.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crmn9m8gm72o"}
