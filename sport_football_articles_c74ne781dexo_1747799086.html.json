We could have prevented it. We scored a good goal but, apart from that, the second half performance was much more what we are like.\n\"Conceding three goals like that is not of the standards of Liverpool. We were creating chance after chance after chance [towards the end]. In the end, we lacked time to make up for the three mistakes we made in the first half.\"\nOn Mohamed Salah not scoring for four club games: \"Maybe he should see it as a compliment [that people are talking about it] because his numbers were not normal [when he was scoring].\n\"The good thing about Mo is that he knows what kind of a player he is. Mo will show up again, I don't worry about that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c74ne781dexo"}
