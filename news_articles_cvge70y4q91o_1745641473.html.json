In the CCTV footage, the front left hub cap also appears to be missing.\nThomas Strobl, interior minister of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, said the man used the vehicle \"as a weapon\".\n\"This act is one of several crimes in the recent past in which a car was misused as a weapon,\" Mr Strobl said, but added that there is no evidence to suggest the incident is connected to the Easter carnival taking place in the city.\nPolice are investigating two counts of murder and several of attempted murder, Mannheim chief public prosecutor Romeo Schluessler told reporters.\nMannheim's mayor described the incident as \"abhorrent and \"inhumane\".\n\"Our thoughts are with the dead and injured, their families and friends,\" Mayor Christian Specht said.\nOlaf Scholz, Germany's outgoing chancellor, thanked the emergency services and wished \"strength\" for eyewitnesses in Mannheim to \"process what they have experienced\".\n\"We mourn with the relatives of the victims of a senseless act of violence and fear for those injured,\" he said in a social media post.\nThe incident comes at a time of heightened security as outdoor carnivals linked to Easter celebrations are held across Germany.\nThere was a parade through the Mannheim city centre on Sunday, with major events scheduled for Tuesday.\nA market has now been closed and a street carnival in the city centre will not take place. Carnival events in the nearby suburbs of Feudenheim, Neckarau and Sandhofen have also been cancelled.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvge70y4q91o"}
