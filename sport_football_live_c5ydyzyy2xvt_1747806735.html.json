That will be debated for a while.\n'Blues completely dominated the second half'\nFT: Birmingham 2-1 Rotherham\nDarren Carter\nEx-Birmingham midfielder on BBC Radio WM\nThey completely dominated the second half, Rotherham didn't really a sight of Blues goal and they didn't really get into the Blues defensive end, blues camped territory wise and you could sense a goal was coming.\nJay Stansfield stepped up like he has so many times this season and gets the equalising goal, and who else do you want to take a pressure penalty it is that man again.\nBut I think it was a fantastic display and this was as impressive result as any this season.\nLeague One full-time round up\n#BBCEFL\nRight then let's bring you the final scores from around the other grounds in League One today.\nBlackpool came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Charlton, Sam Silvera and Niall Ennis scored in the final 20 minutes to earn them a point.\nCrawley Town scored to level the game 1-1 with Wrexham in the 90th minute but Elliot Lee scored a 95th-minute goal to win them the game, cue heartbreak for the home side.\nShrewsbury came from a goal down and having a man sent-off to beat Mansfield Town 2-1 at home, scoring twice in the second half.\nReading beat Bolton, Harvey Knibbs slotted home from the penalty spot late on to win them a big three points.\nNorthampton Town held on as Huddersfield scored twice late but weren't able to get anything out of the game as the Cobblers won 3-2.\nAnd Lincoln City scored an 88th-minute equaliser away to Wigan Athletic to earn a point at The Brick Community Stadium.\nLeague Two full-time round-up\n#bbcefl\nDanny Johnson has broken Salford hearts with a late equaliser for Walsall, his second of the match, with it finishing 2-2.\nPaul Glatzel and Will Wright have added two stoppage time goals to make it 5-1 for in-form Swindon against Carlisle.\nGrimsby have won 2-0 at Bromley, Doncaster have held firm to win 2-1 against MK Dons and retake second spot in the table.\nThere are also wins for Morecambe over Fleetwood, Port Vale, who have beaten Accrington and Colchester who have prevailed against Tranmere.\nHarrogate and Crewe have shared the points after a 1-1 draw while Newport have edged a tight encounter against Barrow 1-0.\nFULL-TIME\nBirmingham 2-1 Rotherham\nBirmingham extend their lead at the top but they were made to work hard for it.\nSam Nombe headed Rotherham into a half-time lead against the run of play.\nWe expected a Blues reaction and while it wasn't quite a case of laying siege to the visitors' goal they did enough.\nFirst Jay Stansfield converted from close range nine minutes after the restart and he then fired home a penalty six minutes before the end after Taylor Gardner-Hickman had been fouled.\nBirmingham go four points clear at the top with two games in hand on their pursuers.\nFULL-TIME\nCambridge United 1-1 Wycombe\nWith Birmingham losing and Wycombe winning at one point this afternoon the Chairboys were going top of League One.\nBut they've been held at the Abbey Stadium by struggling Cambridge United.\nCameron Humphreys gave the visitors the lead before it all kicked-off in the second period.\nSonny Bradley was sent-off for a foul on Michael Morrison but Jordan Stokes saw the resultant penalty saved by Wycombe goalkeeper Franco Ravizzoli.\nStokes made up for the miss with a leveller six minutes from the end.\nQuite a game.\nPost\nAFC Wimbledon 1-0 Bradford\nIt is looking increasingly likely the Dons are going to hold firm against Bradford who are huffing and puffing without looking like break the door down.\nThere should be a few minutes extras on account of the injury to Ciaran Kelly but if you were a betting man money would be going on a second for Wimbledon rather than an equaliser.\nLatest in League One\n#bbcefl\nWell Northampton Town looked to be cruising to victory in their game against Huddersfield but in the past ten minutes the visitors have got two goals back to make it 3-2 with just over five minutes remaining.\nHerbie Kane and Jonathan Hogg have scored the two goals in quick succession.
