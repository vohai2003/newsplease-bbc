He's a fantastic player and he'll get 20 or 25 minutes,\" Bulls player-coach Victor Matfield told BBC Sport.\n\"For him it's about getting through the game, feeling good, and then hopefully he can have a big season.\"\nSpies, the Bulls captain, initially tore a biceps in the Quadrangular Tournament final against Samoa in the summer of 2013.\nHe made an attempted comeback at the beginning of last year, but aggravated the injury and required a second operation.\nThe Pretoria-born number eight, who missed South Africa's 2007 World Cup-winning campaign with blood clots on his lungs, is one of 15 Springboks in the Bulls squad to face Saracens at Allianz Park.\n\"It's an important game for us. There's a lot of pride on the game,\" said 37-year-old Matfield, whose 121 Test appearances makes him South Africa's most capped player.\n\"We know that Saracens play with a hard-rush defence. We are trying to get better at playing against that type of defence, so we'll see if it's working for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/31042794"}
