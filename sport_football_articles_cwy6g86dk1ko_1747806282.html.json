It's a game of football as well.\"\nOn Diogo Jota goal: \"In the moment I can't see what's happening, but Jarrad [Branthwaite] said it was a stonewall offside straight away. But I'm not a referee and I wouldn't want to be. It's a big debate and we'll see what the referees come out and say.\n\"As a team we thought it was offside but that's football. We're disappointed with that decision but it can't be perfect always.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy6g86dk1ko"}
