The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are \"misunderstood\".\nRomanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain \"under judicial control\" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania.\nHowever their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.\nThe Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.\nIn the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.\nThe brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them.\nUpon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: \"We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\"\n\"There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,\" he said, adding that they are \"yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever\".\nThe brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US.\nA lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.\n\"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,\" Mr McBride said in a statement.\nSpeaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.\nAsked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: \"I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?\"\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: \"There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk.\"\nOn Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft.\nTheir arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month.\nThe Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading \"millions of young men\" to back him \"cannot be overlooked\".\nRomania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago.\nEmil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach \"a form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his \"publicly available tweets\".\nHowever, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men.\nAndrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views.\nHe and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking.\nThey both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.\nA former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion.\nIn the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him.\nThose plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action.\n\"We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,\" the women said in a statement.\nElena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave.\n\"I am outraged!\" she wrote on social media, \"as a woman, a human being and a Romanian.\" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure.\nProsecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed.\nAny violation of those obligations made in bad faith \"may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty\", it said in a statement in Romanian, external.\nFollowing a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts.\nThis comes after court limitations were \"modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,\" the statement from the Tates' representative said.\nThe Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them.\nRomania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance's eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US.\nSenior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December's presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia.\nGeorgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted \"incitement to acts against the constitutional order\". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a \"formalised coup d'etat\". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpq222rqv4po"}
