Then we move on to Bilbao from there. Hoping to be in Bilbao by 15:00-16:00.\nTristen: 07:15 flight tomorrow morning, then a 16:00 flight back on Thursday. No accommodation booked or I guess even needed - bars and clubs after the game till the early hours celebrating our win, then a coffee shop to wake myself up and sit in the sun till our flight home.
