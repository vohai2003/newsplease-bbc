They don't give up. I like that.\nDaniel: A positive view on what the season could hold for us as we started off shaky but held on late and took our chance. It was great to see Trossard replicate his form and see how good Timber is. It's clear to see as an Arsenal fan. Iâ€™m excited for the new season.\nKris: Beating Manchester City is a statement of intent by Arsenal that they are ready to start winning trophies.\nCharles: This Arsenal squad looked switched on, focused and ready for the challenge. Most importantly they look like they're having some fun. Big season ahead.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cl5e0dqg203o"}
