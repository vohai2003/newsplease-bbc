Looking back then, I was drinking the night before an All-Ireland Final.\"\nHulgraine added that she has to battle against a sense of \"shame\" that can envelope her when she thinks about those dark days.\n\"I really do work and praying over it and that shame and condemnation that comes with stuff, I really do have to try and not let that get in.\n\"That's a battle. That's called spiritual warfare I suppose. It's a constant battle to be like 'I'm not listening to you today'. I have a bit of work to do yet I think.\"\nThe Kildare keeper also talks about the role her beloved dog Bailey played in her recovery.\n\"I was anxious when I wasn't with him. There was a very strong emotional attachment there.\n\"Someone said 'God brought that dog to keep you going and now he's saying, his job is doneâ€¦..we're bringing him home',\" said Mary of Bailey, who had to be put to sleep last June because of illness.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cj675g170ggo"}
