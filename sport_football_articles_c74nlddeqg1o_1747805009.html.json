Frankly, I don't think you have.\n\"I don't think he has been the same player since his injury. I don't think he's been the same player since the transfer talk and although he's young and I don't want to pick on him, I don't see the same player in the past two months.\"\nFormer Saints player Jo Tessem added: \"With the game we had against Crystal Palace, [boss Ivan Juric] doesn't need to make many changes. He just needs to put the same team out again - without Flynn Downes obviously - because he is suspended and go with that.\n\"I think that would keep a little bit of calmness in there towards the Tottenham game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c74nlddeqg1o"}
