We can't be conceding sloppy and silly goals.\n\"I think from now on it's one game a week â€“ it is always hard with Europe, but even with that we shouldn't be where we are. I think we have enough talent in that changing room to be better and I think we will be better.\n\"But with fewer games, the gaffer can have a lot of time with us to instill what he wants, whereas maybe before it was like, you're playing Sunday, you're playing Thursday, you didn't have that time, but now I think there are no excuses and I think we will definitely be able to turn it round.\"\nIn their last two games, Hearts have drawn with fourth-placed Aberdeen and defeated third-place Dundee United, which the midfielder hopes can breed confidence and a better mentality.\n\"There are a lot of games left and we need to get ourselves out of this,\" he stressed.\n\"We are nine points away from St Johnstone, it's not a nice feeling to be second bottom.\n\"We don't like it, I know the fans don't like it so ultimately we can't be looking up too much, without understanding the reality of where we are. We are in a situation that we shouldn't be in or I don't believe that we should be in and taking it one game at a time will be the best thing.\n\"We have beat Dundee United who are third at times we were the better team today, away at the team who are fourth so why shouldn't we have that mentality?\n\"With that mentality, get out of this situation, get out of this hole that you have placed yourself in and hopefully your ability will show.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cr7envxdmz2o"}
