Tyrone).\nOn Tuesday Scotland had its warmest day of the year so far with Kinlochewe in the Highlands hitting 20C during the afternoon.\nThere's a good chance that the highest temperature recorded so far this year - 21.3C at Chertsey (Surrey) and Northolt (London) on 20 March - will be beaten later this week.\nHowever, a cool easterly breeze will continue to suppress the warmth for some - especially along North Sea coasts. Nights will also continue to be chilly under the clear skies with pockets of frost forming in prone spots.\nThe dry and settled weather will continue to the end of the week for most, with the possibility of a few showers creeping into south-west England briefly.\nAs we head into the weekend a plunge of cooler air is expected to move southwards out of Scandinavia and easterly winds will allow some of this cooler air to spread across the UK bringing temperatures back down closer to normal for early April.\nLow cloud and mist might affect eastern areas of the UK making it feel quite chilly. However, sheltered western areas will continue to see the sunshine where it'll feel more pleasant.\nIt is worth bearing in mind that UV levels are moderate as the Sun gains strength at this time of year.\nModerate levels of tree pollen are also predicted - especially for parts of England and Wales.\nYou can keep up to date with your local weather on the BBC Weather website and app.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cp91zzejm59o"}
