I've spoken with the manager and he's given me reassurance, that trust I needed.\n\"He's spoken with me not just as a player but as a person. It's made a big difference.\"\nColwill has been at the club since the age of eight but has spent the past two seasons starring on loan at Huddersfield and Brighton.\n\"Levi is an outstanding player who has risen to every challenge in his career so far,\" said co-sporting directors Laurence Stanley and Paul Winstanley.\n\"We are thrilled he will remain at Chelsea for years to come.\"\nThe deal includes an option to extend his stay by a further 12 months when the six-year contract concludes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4nl0mxn6ezo"}
