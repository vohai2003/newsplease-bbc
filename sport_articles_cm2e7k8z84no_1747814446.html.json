Important players out injured, but the players coming in really have to step up to the plate. We always give teams in need the win and I'm now dreading our next game against Aberdeen.\nRyan: Lennon Miller was a big miss. We were not in the game at all until the final five minutes. Our performances have been very Jekyll and Hyde all season which I don't know why.\nEddie: When is the manager going to take responsibility? He signed the players and set up the system. The football is dire to watch and we barely reach 40% possession even at home.\nJames: Pathetic display. Just not good enough. Poor passing, no energy, easy to play against. Some deadwood needing rid of, and some new faces required to spark things up.\nKevin: We could have 11 Brazilians playing for us and Stuart Kettlewell would still have them all behind the ball and passing back the way. He keeps going on about this tenure. The longer his tenure continues the more he's making Craig Levein look attack minded. Brutal.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cm2e7k8z84no"}
