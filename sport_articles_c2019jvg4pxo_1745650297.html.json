He believes it was an encouraging performance at Motherwell in midweek despite the defeat.\n\"We have been really blighted by injuries,\" the Dark Blues boss says, but emphasised there is \"real mental toughness\" in the squad.\nHe insists the players and staff are working hard to \"turn this round and it is encouraging that you see a dressing room that are fully together\".\nAntonio Portales, Clark Robertson and Seb Palmer-Houlden are out for \"four to six weeks\" and and while it is \"really frustrating\" to have key players missing, Docherty was \"delighted\" with Charlie Reilly's performance at Fir Park and is hopeful Scott Fraser will be back with the squad next week.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c2019jvg4pxo"}
