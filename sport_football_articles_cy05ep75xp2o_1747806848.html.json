The 10 meetings between the pair at Etihad Stadium in the competition have produced a total of 43 goals (Manchester City 25, Leicester 18).\nLeicester have conceded the first goal in 24 of their 29 Premier League games this season - at least five more than anyone else. Should they fall 1-0 behind to Manchester City here, it will be the outright most times a team has conceded first in their opening 30 matches of a Premier League campaign (25), surpassing Ipswich's record from 1994-95 (24).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy05ep75xp2o"}
