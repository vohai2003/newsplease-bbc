We needed to get that result. Enormous pride in the players but also I think we showed our strengths as a football club.\n\"You saw a real strength, a real mentality, a real resilience about the squad. Wee Lyall Cameron to score the two goals, it's very fitting for Lyall. No surprise, but delighted for him. Our last three games, Lyall's scored four goals. Lyall's character's never been in question. His quality is outstanding. Lyall's going to have a fantastic career. Him amongst others really answered up.\n\"I don't want to be a manager of a team that's sitting in the bottom six. When the time's right, we'll reflect fully on it. There has been inconsistency there. We need to recruit well but the players that have been in there and will be moving on, I need to thank them for what they've done for the football club. The ones that are here, we need to kick on for next year's campaign.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cpvkrn1wvzmo"}
