Yet with England, he was more effective as a wide attacker.\nI have always felt Mountâ€™s ability to read a game, execute a gameplan and be disciplined positionally were his major attributes. Marking your man might seem a pretty basic requirement, but how many goals are conceded because players switch off defensively and someone ends up unmarked?\nMount is a tidy player. He is inventive and has a good passing range. But I am not sure United will get the best out of him if he is in a central position.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cq529vv20yvo"}
