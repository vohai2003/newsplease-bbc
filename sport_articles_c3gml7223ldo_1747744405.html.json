They'll back him at Celtic.\n\"Over at our place, I think Michael Beale has brought in nine players. I watched them against Newcastle in pre-season, did OK. I watched them against Olympiakos, didn't look great. Didn't look good in the first half against Hoffenheim and then looked great in the second half.\n\"So, I don't really know but of course Rangers and Celtic have got to hit the ground running, particularly Rangers with the (Champions League) qualifier coming up.\n\"It is a tough one to call. I don't know how Rangers' players will settle in. They brought them in quickly.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3gml7223ldo"}
