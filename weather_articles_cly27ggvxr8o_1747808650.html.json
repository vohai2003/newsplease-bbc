Tyrone).\nThe clocks went forward on Sunday ushering in the start of British Summer Time (BST) with sunset times now after 19:00 BST across the whole of the UK.\nIn fact, in parts of Northern Ireland the Sun does not set until after 20:00 BST meaning plenty of extra evening daylight and sunshine.\nIt is worth bearing in mind that UV levels are expected to be moderate as the Sun gains strength at this time of year.\nModerate levels of tree pollen are also predicted - especially for parts of England and Wales.\nTemperatures will climb into the high-teens Celsius for most parts of the UK with a few places reaching the low-twenties.\nThe highest temperature recorded so far this year was 21.3C (70.3F) at Chertsey (Surrey) and Northolt (London) on 20 March and there is a chance that this may be exceeded this week.\nThe location of the warmest weather will shift as the week goes on.\nInitially northern Scotland may see the highest temperatures with 19 or 20C (66-68F) likely in the Highlands during midweek.\nA chilly breeze blowing from the North Sea will mean cooler conditions for some eastern coasts.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cly27ggvxr8o"}
