Here is what the managers said after the game:\nMarc Skinner, speaking to BBC Sport: \"I was [pleased with the performance], first half especially. I felt we might fall off a little bit second half because we have only had two days from international duty. Winners find a way to win and we have done that. We have already accrued more points now with seven games to go than we did last season.\"\nOn Melvine Malard's goal in Elisabeth Terland's absence and his selection headache: \"A great headache. I am so pleased for Mel today, she deserved that. She worked tirelessly.\"\nAmandine Miquel speaking to BBC Sport: \"We didn't do enough in the first half clearly. We were better in the second half but it wasn't enough. We gave ourselves troubles alone. We were late, we didn't move as a block and we opened up options for them which made it easier for them to score.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c5yrk7mx11eo"}
