One minute we are hiring managers who wants to play expansive football and then we bring in Sean Dyche and we are left with a mix of players who all different managers have signed.\n\"It's been a real mish-mash of a squad over the years.\n\"Moyes built a clear pathway to what Everton were about and it was great going to games knowing the team were going to be competitive. That can't really be said for the last few years.\n\"The supporters know there are limitations and expectations we can't quite reach at the moment but Moyes has given us that in the past and that is probably why there is a warm feeling around his re-appointment.\n\"Fans hope he can try and give us some of that back.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgly481e27po"}
