The Lions have never previously won four in a row against Pompey.\nThis is Portsmouth's first away league visit to Millwall since Boxing Day in 2011 â€“ the Lions won 1-0 with a goal from Dany N'Guessan.\nMillwall are looking to win back-to-back home league games for the first time since a run of three in October and November earlier this campaign.\nPortsmouth have won five of their last eight league games (L3). Since the start of this run on 11 February, only Burnley (20), Sheffield United (19) and Coventry (18) have picked up more points than Pompey (15).\nPortsmouth's Josh Murphy has been involved in seven goals in his last nine Championship appearances (2 goals, 5 assists) and has 10 assists overall for Pompey this season. The last player with more in a league season for the club was Ricky Holmes in 2013-14 (11).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y4g41xe84o"}
