After taking 14 games to score his first goal, he went on to manage 45 in 172 games for Chelsea, and just 20 in 110 Premier League appearances.\nHe may have won the Champions League and FA Cup in 2012, but did not start either final and was an unused substitute in the latter.\nTorres later said on the move: \"I always said it was my fault. I was old enough to find solutions but I didn't do it. I won the trophies but I didn't do it every week.\"\nMichael Owen\nMichael Owen signed for Liverpool aged 12 and had won two Premier League Golden Boots by the age of 19. His meteoric rise continued and two years later he played a key role in a treble of the EFL Cup, FA Cup and Uefa Cup, becoming the fourth English player to win the Ballon d'Or.\nFollowing an injury-plagued 2003-04 season, Owen signed for Real Madrid but struggled for form and consistency among Real's Galaticos. He managed 16 goals in 45 games but returned to the Premier League with Newcastle just a year later for a club-record fee.\nHe never recovered his Liverpool form, playing just 79 games across four seasons at St James' Park before tarnishing his Anfield legacy by joining arch-rivals Manchester United.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c86p8wxj9v6o"}
