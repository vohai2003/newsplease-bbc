Had a few cleared off the line and in the second half I think we just kind of went down a level, but the biggest thing is just really set pieces win and lose you a game and for us it's cost us a game, not defending set pieces properly.\n\"It was nice to see us getting into that final third and creating chances and it's sometimes just that final pass or that decision making. We've had a couple cleared off the line and another day they're going in.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/clyznp5k39ro"}
