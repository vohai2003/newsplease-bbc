Parity lasted just another five minutes as Lia Lewis restored Saints' lead and that proved enough for victory to boost their hopes of record-high, third-place finish in the league.\nWrexham 4-2 Cardiff City: Cardiff, having secured the Adran Premier title last week, led early through Laura Curnock but trailed at half-time after Wrexham hit back through Rosie Hughes and Abbie Iddenden. Lily Billingham grabbed a Cardiff equaliser on 55 minutes, only for Iddenden to wrap up the game for Wrexham and complete her hat-trick in the process.\nPlate Conference\nBarry Town United 0-2 Cardiff Met: First-half goals from Ruby Colleton and Molly Chapman put Met in command at Jenner Park and the hosts never quite found a way back into the game.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c99pyk1gxjno"}
