They will probably see how the game pans out and wait to see if they need her.\nI don't think it will be straight-forward at all for the co-hosts, but I am going to go with my heart and say they will make it - the tournament really needs them to get through too.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-2\nThe Republic of Ireland are out but they have competed so well, exactly the way I was hoping they would.\nNigeria, meanwhile, have surpassed all expectations - including my own - but fully deserve to be top of Group B. From what we've seen so far, no-one will want to play them in the last 16.\nThey are not too bothered about dominating possession or indeed any other set of stats. They are only concerned about being really hard to break down. Chiamaka Nnadozie has been excellent in goal too, and then up the other end they can rely on stardust to get their goals.\nA draw would be enough to send Nigeria through no matter what happens elsewhere, and the Republic would be happy with that outcome too, because it would give them their first World Cup point.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-0\nThis World Cup feels wide open from what we've seen so far and I would include both of these teams in my list of five or six serious contenders who have either been really impressive or look like they have another couple of gears to find.\nWith their progress already assured, they are both trying to top group C, but I don't think either will fear whoever they end up facing out of Group A. I could see Japan or Spain going on to win the tournament, they have been that good.\nIt's hard to pick a winner here, but I am going to go with Spain to take it, just about.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-2\nThis has been the group of 1-0 wins so far - all four results have ended up with that scoreline so I am backing that trend to continue.\nEngland only need one point to make it out of Group D but I think they will get all three, and then who joins them could come down to fair play points, and be decided by the number of yellow cards each team has received.\nWe want the Lionesses to stay clear of all of that, and I am confident they will get the job done.\nChina are capable of making things difficult for England, however, and seeing them toil with 10 men to beat Haiti in their last match was very impressive.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-1\nHaiti can feel hard done by to have been beaten in both of their games so far, losing to a penalty on each occasion, but you just know they will go for it again against Denmark and maybe this is when their luck turns.\nIf England beat China it opens the door for Haiti to get out of Group D with a win, although it might come down to fair play points. It is going to be so close that I can see a conundrum like that happening at the end of it.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-0\nThe USA will go through if they avoid defeat and although they have made something of a slow start in Group E, I can't see them having too many problems against Portugal.\nThe defending champions are one of the teams I am expecting to ramp it up as the World Cup goes on, because they have a lot of younger players who are taking part in their first tournament and learning the ropes.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-3\nThe Netherlands only need a draw here to make the last 16 but they should win comfortably.\nI liked what I saw from the Dutch in their draw with the USA and that performance bodes well for the tests to come in the knockout stage.\nThey have found a really effective way of playing and breaking teams down without the injured Vivianne Miedema, and they look the real deal.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-2\nI really enjoyed co-commentating on France's win over Brazil - France's squad depth made the difference in the end, with the players they brought on, but either team could have won it.\nHopefully that was a sign of what we'll see more of in the knockout stages, with not much of a gap between the teams, but France should run out easy winners here to ensure they go through.\nThey looked brilliant down the left-hand side against Brazil and they should be too organised, and also too dynamic, for Panama to deal with.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-2\nArgentina need a win to have any chance of progressing, but that is just not happening.\nSweden are already though, and reminded everyone with their big win against Italy what powerhouses they are.\nThey have got the opportunity to rest several players here but I don't think they will, and I can see them steamrollering over Argentina in the same way.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-3\nSouth Africa need to win this one to finish second, otherwise Italy go through.\nIt is a huge moment for both teams, but especially Banyana Banyana, who are playing in only their second World Cup and have not made it out of the groups before.\nIf they can play like they did against Sweden, I can see South Africa doing it. That's why I am backing them, because I have seen how they can play, but they will have to change their habit of conceding late goals.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-0\nThis has been the group of shocks, with the latest one being Germany's last-gasp defeat by Colombia. I certainly didn't see that one coming.\nEven so, I still think Germany will be too strong for South Korea - who have not scored a goal or picked up a point so far - and there is only one winner here.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 0-2\nColombia's success against South Korea in their opening game caught me out, but it was a bigger surprise when Morocco did the same too, for their first ever World Cup win.\nMorocco are ranked 72nd in the world while South Korea are a top 20 team, so that was a great achievement.\nThere is a similar gulf in rankings here - Colombia are number 25, and they showed how good they are when they beat Germany in their second game. They only need a point to go through, but I think they will get all three.\nBrown-Finnis' prediction: 1-3", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66336122"}
