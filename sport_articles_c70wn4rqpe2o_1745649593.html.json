Stopped doing things we were doing first half, didn't pass the ball well enough, were too passive, disjointed in our defending and we allowed too many balls into our box. In the end that's led to a great goal.\n\"We spoke about it at half-time about how we wanted to step up and play the second half, and we didn't. We allowed them to play the game they wanted to play and that suited them.\n\"That wasn't like us, it's not been like us and it's something we need to do better at.\n\"It's bitterly disappointing to lose a derby so we have to take the criticism. We have to respond. We're at home against Dundee in the cup and we have to show a response.\n\"I didn't recognise the team in the second half which is really disappointing. We didn't show a response from going 2-1 down.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c70wn4rqpe2o"}
