The paper's comment page says there's reason to believe this \"odd couple\" could \"forge a fruitful partnership\".\nThe Daily Mirror, external and the i newspaper, external called the prime minister \"Charmer Starmer\", with the latter describing the meeting as a \"diplomatic win\". A \"love-in\" is the phrase used by the Sun and the Daily Express.\nIn The Times, columnist Matthew Parris is less complimentary, writing that the president \"patronised\" Sir Keir and that it must have taken him \"a fair amount of self-control not to pat our prime minister on the head\".\nThe Guardian, external highlights Trump's insistence that American workers extracting minerals in Ukraine would deter a future Russian invasion - whereas the Financial Times says the president dashed hopes of US cover should European peacekeepers go to Ukraine.\nThe Daily Telegraph, external seizes on Trump's suggestion that he would back UK plans to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The paper's editorial calls the meeting a \"missed opportunity\". It says the prime minister had \"room to advance Britain's interests\", but instead \"focused on getting his Chagos surrender over the line\".\nThe Mirror's editorial says Sir Keir passed the \"Trump Test\". It says the president's support for the Chagos deal underlines how Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage are \"marginalised and powerless\". Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick argues in an article for the Express that handing over the territory would be a \"strategic disaster\".\nThe front page of the Express references the US leader's hints about a future trade agreement to Brexit. \"Trump backs 'Great Trade Deal' for Brexit Britain\" is its headline. On the inside pages, the paper's editorial calls it an \"unexpected but very welcome announcement\" after \"Joe Biden refused to discuss an agreement\".\nThe Sun, external draws attention to the prime minister's offer of an unprecedented second state visit, which it refers to as Sir Keir's \"Trump card\". The paper points out that other second term presidents, such as Barack Obama, were only offered tea or lunch at Windsor Castle. The article says the Royal Family's \"soft power diplomacy is seen as an effective way of engaging\" Trump.\nMany of the papers also carry tributes to actor Gene Hackman, who was found dead at home alongside his wife in unexplained circumstances. The Mirror says he \"brought a raw intensity to every character he played\". The Telegraph describes him as one of Hollywood's \"most versatile\" actors who balanced \"toughness and sensitivity in edgy portrayals of troubled middle age\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99nnkgk3g9o"}
