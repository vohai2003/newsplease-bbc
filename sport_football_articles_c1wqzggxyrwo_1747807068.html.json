An extra goal here and there would make all the difference.\nCity have scored three times in their last two home games against Everton. Haaland has got them all.\nHow Guardiola needs the striker to find the net again on Boxing Day.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1wqzggxyrwo"}
