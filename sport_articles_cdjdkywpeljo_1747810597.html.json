She did, to see Kansas City beat San Francisco in overtime.\nThis time there is little doubt over her presence, while former first lady Jill Biden – a lifelong Philly fan – is also expected to be there.\nSwift was joined by Caitlin Clark for one of the Chiefs' play-off games, and the global music star watched Super Bowl 58 with Blake Lively and her boyfriend's brother Jason. He was wearing Kansas City dungarees that day, but this year he's backing his former team as his wife Kylie is a diehard Eagles fan.\nBradley Cooper and Rob McElhenney have watched games with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, while other Philly fans include Will Smith, Kevin Hart and Tina Fey.\nKansas City fans Sheryl Crow and Paul Rudd were at Super Bowl 58, while Brad Pitt and Jason Sudeikis are also Chiefs fans.\nOther celebrities there last year included Elon Musk, Justin Bieber, Leonardo DiCaprio, Paul McCartney, Beyonce, Jay Z, LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdjdkywpeljo"}
