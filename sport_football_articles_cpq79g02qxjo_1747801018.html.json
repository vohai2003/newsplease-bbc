I'm proud of them.\n\"I thought the lads were outstanding. I'm delighted to get the three points and so many positive aspects from the performance as well.\n\"You look at the profile of [Watford], you know it's going to be a really physical tough game and especially as they've got some talented individuals that can change it in a moment.\n\"You have to manage that by taking care of the ball and I think first-half was excellent as to how we did that. We kept them penned in.\n\"Second half was one of those where they had a lot of the ball but didn't carry as much threat as we did on the counter. It's that stage of the season where it's about finding a way to win and we did it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpq79g02qxjo"}
