After all Ruben Amorim was so disarmingly honest a few weeks back saying \"we've got such a long way to go!\" Not that long it seems! What has made the difference?\nPhil replied: Hi, Brian. I've been really impressed with Manchester United in their last two games. The sheer fight and determination has been outstanding, apart from all the other qualities.\nI think we need to reserve judgement though, Brian, because even Bruno Fernandes has said it's OK doing it against Liverpool and Arsenal, but you have to do it every game.\nRuben Amorim said the club needed a \"shock\" and maybe his brutal honesty delivered it.\nIt is clear the players are playing for him and maybe they are now becoming more accustomed to his three-man central defensive strategy.\nLet's not kid ourselves, though. Amorim still has a massive rebuilding job on his hands and two good results and performances do not change that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c627j74485ro"}
