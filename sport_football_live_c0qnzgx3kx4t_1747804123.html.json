It was bent over the wall from 25 yards and found the corner to light up a half that lacked much goalmouth action.\nThe second half started with a free-kick blasted over the top by Kamari Doyle and then Panutche Camara also put one over the bar.\nBut Ibrahim squeezed a Jack Roles cross inside the post to seemingly gave Crawley hope.\nThat would be extinguished in those closing minutes as Reid headed home at the back post before a fine low finish from Kemp made the points secure.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c0qnzgx3kx4t"}
