Meanwhile, Richarlison is available following a period on the sidelines.\nIn response to whether they will sign a forward: \"It's hard to say. Like most other clubs, January is a difficult month to have any other certainty. It is a difficult month for everything to come together.\"\nHe said they \"can't afford to let players go\" in this transfer window because of the ongoing injury crisis, but some \"young ones\" may be sent out on loan.\nOn whether the north London derby comes at a good time because Arsenal also have multiple players injured: \"We've been in this position for a while now. There's some light at the end of the tunnel. We need to start winning games and moving up the table.\"\nHe said he has \"empathy, not sympathy\" for Mikel Arteta's situation, adding: \"I don't think they have sympathy for us.\"\nOn the crowd at Tamworth: \"Some of the stuff I heard was vile and detestable and I had things thrown at me. People expect me to be the better person, but I didn't want to be the better person.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2y7vygdpvo"}
