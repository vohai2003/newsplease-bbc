She is so special and you can see what she can do in tight spaces.\"\nJames described it as \"an amazing feeling\", adding it was \"something I've always dreamed of\".\nHer impact was immediate. Every time she had the ball at her feet she was direct and the 40,439 watching from the stands in Australia were full of excitement.\nEngland had 82% possession in the opening 15 minutes and James had three shots, more than any other player on the pitch.\n\"For someone so young, Lauren James just took the game by the scruff of the neck,\" Lionesses' record goalscorer Ellen White told BBC One.\n\"She really dictated the tempo of the game. I just love the way she manipulates the ball. Scoring at a World Cup is a dream for her and hopefully she can continue this now and take it into the next games.\"\nWiegman has been careful not to overhype James.\nDuring the Arnold Clark Cup, when captain Leah Williamson said James was like a video game 'cheat code', Wiegman said she was \"still building\".\nAnd after the victory over Denmark, Wiegman again had a low-key reaction.\n\"Yes, she did well,\" said Wiegman. \"We really thought we needed players in the pockets. That's where she came a lot, together with Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone, and that worked really well.\n\"And yes she made a very nice goal. We are very careful with her. She is a young, talented player and we were really happy with her performance - but just as we were with the rest of the team.\"\nBut it is clear she stands out from the crowd. As Lucy Bronze stated in February, \"Everyone has been waiting for this superstar\" - and James showed glimpses of her potential against Denmark.\nOlder brother Reece James - an England and Chelsea star himself - posted on social media that he was \"proud\" of Lauren's performance.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66337316"}
