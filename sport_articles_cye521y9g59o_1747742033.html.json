We knew, if we did that, we’d have a real good chance.\n\"We had to show a different version of ourselves against the Old Firm this season. Rangers will get better, but I think we’ll get better as well.\n\"Our level of performance had to be really good today, but we delivered that. It’s a really strong start.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cye521y9g59o"}
