Of course, we know each other quite well and we are quite honest with that.\n\"In that situation, he has to decide, that is the most important thing. He's completely honest with himself, to decide what he feels and what he can do in the next period of his life.\n\"He is 34 in the summer and he has to decide - like what happened with David Silva, for example.\"\nDe Bruyne has previously been linked with moves away to Major League Soccer in the United States or Saudi Pro League, but he could also remain at Manchester City in a reduced role.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/clyrk0885mzo"}
