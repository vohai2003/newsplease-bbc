I feel definitely, yes, we will survive,\" he said. \"The boys know what is being asked of them.\n\"We've lost games everyone expects us to win, but then we go and do something and pick ourselves up again. I feel we are in that moment again now.\n\"We had one point at the start of the season, so where we've come from to where we are nowâ€¦ all we can do is try and win games. Stay positive and win games.\"\nRiza feels confident that his side can pick up the points they need, speculating that around 50 points is likely to be the total needed for safety.\n\"It's in our hands,\" he said. \"At the moment we are above that (relegation) line.\n\"We are one point above the relegation zone. We are focused. We have to take points and avoid relegation.\n\"We need to be in survival mode. We have to do what we have to do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgr2evjnk9zo"}
