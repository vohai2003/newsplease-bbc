He just keeps on going, which is the most impressive thing.\n\"He's class, and it's class to have him back.\"\nHarrison was pleased with the way Edinburgh bounced back from a disappointing loss to Benetton in Italy last weekend.\n\"Obviously, we needed a win this week, it was pretty obvious,\" said the hooker.\n\"The boys did pretty well. I was pretty gutted last week to lose it at the end of the game.\n\"We came out firing this week, so it was pretty good.\n\"We chatted about having a fast start at the start of the game and we definitely did that. We took our chances when we had them, so I'm pretty pleased.\n\"It's obviously really tight around that end of the table. Every game is a huge game for us going forward.\n\"We need to be putting those performances out every week.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdele64wpnyo"}
