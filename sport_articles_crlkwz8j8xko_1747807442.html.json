He has been working so hard.\n\"Hamilton came with a game plan and didn't bend it at any minute. How we dealt with this cup tie was very good. We knew they would get a couple of chances, and we kept going.\n\"We kept pushing and in the end we get our result. I had a good feeling because we did the right things.\n\"We now leave the cup competition for a while and concentrate on the Premiership.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crlkwz8j8xko"}
