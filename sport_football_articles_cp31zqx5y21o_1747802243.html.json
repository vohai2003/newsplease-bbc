As well as being a great professional, he was a good gentleman. So long, we will miss you. Wishing you a very happy future.\nGraham: Without a doubt Kevin de Bruyne is one of Manchester City's greatest ever players. Kevin along with David Silva and Colin Bell are the three best players to wear the sky blue shirt Thanks for so many great memories and your contribution to so many trophies and achievements over the past 10 years Kevin. You will never be forgotten.\nPenny: So sad. I remember asking a Chelsea fan about him when he first arrived as I was sceptical. He said: \"I think he'll be OK for you.\" Well, he certainly has been! Gutted.\nMark: What a man, what a player. He will be sorely missed. I introduced my grandsons to City 15 years ago having followed City for 53 years and we are sad to see the end of an icon. We will wear our number 17 shirts forever.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp31zqx5y21o"}
