We respect them, but we don't fear any team.\n\"We have just got to stay together. If we control everything we can control, I am sure we will be fine,\" said 18-year-old Lewis-Skelly.\nMikel Areta's squad have been hit by injuries this season, with defenders Gabriel and Jurrien Timber going off with problems during the 2-1 victory over Fulham.\nHowever, Arsenal do have their talisman Bukayo Saka back just in time, and Lewis-Skelly added: \"He helps us a lot. He has a presence about him, he knows what he is doing and he has belief in himself.\n\"When he has the ball at his feet he creates magic.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgp4ezkj5po"}
