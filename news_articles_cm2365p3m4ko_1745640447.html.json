In the UK, we focus a lot more on positive action,\" Ms Cooper says.\nShe explains that affirmative action involves quotas, while positive action encourages participation without preferential treatment, such as through scholarships or mentoring.\nMartha Lane Fox, who has worked to promote diversity in the tech sector, believes the UK has an opportunity to \"lean into diversity - stand apart from the US\".\nShe points out the \"irony\", external of Elon Musk, tasked by Donald Trump with slashing federal government spending, standing in the Oval Office with his young son as he dismantled DEI programmes.\n\"Imagine if everyone had such casual and extraordinary opportunities for childcare, what could we unlock?\"\nThe CIPD, the professional body for HR, notes some change to DEI (also known as EDI) policies, with companies such as BT dropping diversity measures from its managers' bonus scheme., external\n\"We're seeing some UK organisations reposition or re-evaluate their EDI initiatives and metrics,\" says Peter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD.\n\"Some of this will be in response to what is happening in America but it's a shift that has been building for a while.\n\"The current climate â€“ social and political - is making organisations look at what they're doing and why, how they're measuring the impact of these initiatives, and the difference their EDI policies are making to business outcomes.\"\nA spokesperson for BT said the changes do not represent a rollback on the company's EDI commitments.\nIn the US even tech giant Apple, which points to its \"north star of dignity and respect for everyone\", has been forced to admit that it may need to make some changes to its policies \"as the legal landscape around this issue evolves\".\nLast month, consulting giant Accenture also cited the \"evolving landscape\" as it said it was ending employee representation goals, external and career development programmes for \"people of specific demographic groups\".\nThe company, which employs around 11,000 people in the UK, said the change in its policies and practices would apply \"globally, and not just in the US\".\nIt also noted that it had \"largely achieved\" its diversity goals.\nSimilarly, investment bank Goldman Sachs told the BBC earlier this month that it had axed an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.\nAnn Cairns, who is the chair of Crown Agents Bank and Trust Management Finance Group, and also sits on the board of London Business School, says she isn't surprised that DEI policies are under attack.\n\"We swing back and forth on this topic depending on who is in power and their influence. Some bigger companies are being driven by America but we will have to wait and see what happens.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2365p3m4ko"}
