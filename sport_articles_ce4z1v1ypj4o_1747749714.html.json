Brentford manager Thomas Frank has been speaking about the situation.\n\"David is a Brentford player so far and I haven’t been told anything different,\" said Frank.\n\"It’s an open secret that we are willing to sell him for the right amount. He’s training hard and a good professional.\n\"Right now he’s at the club and then we will find the best to do. I think it’s natural that he would like to leave if it’s a good opportunity for him. We all think it’s a good idea at the right price.\n\"That probably means going towards that and focusing on the other keepers we have, I think that is completely natural.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ce4z1v1ypj4o"}
