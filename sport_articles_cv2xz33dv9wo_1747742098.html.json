The players battled hard against the conditions, which led to thrills and spills aplenty.\nIf either side was nervous on the opening day of the season, it was hard to tell. Both were clearly keen to play football - Motherwell building through Miller, Spittal and Slattery while Dundee countered with Cameron and McCowan.\nAnd both sides could also be upset only leaving with a point.
