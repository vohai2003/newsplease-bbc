We need to come out and say sorry to them. You have to face up to it.\n\"There are lots of little excuses you could say, but overall the performance wasn’t there. The gaffer said his words, but before we got in we spoke up and said it wasn’t good enough.\n\"It’s one of those days. They’re a well-drilled side. It means the absolute world to them. I’ve played a dozen of these games now and they’re never easy. It can be sticky. But we know we should be a lot better.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cj5neyqdje5o"}
