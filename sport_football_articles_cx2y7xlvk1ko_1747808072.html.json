That is [Jack Grealish's] strength. He's gone away from his strength; he's gone away from everything that is Jack Grealish. It's been trained out of him.\n\"When was the last time he picked the ball up and done the maverick side of things and got people off their seats? I don't see people getting off seats any more.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2y7xlvk1ko"}
