Six games without a win later and they are third, trailing Rangers by a point and having played a game more.\nThings were looking up for the Dons on Saturday when Topi Keskinen scored a deflected opener against Hibernian but the visitors roared back with three goals to claim all three points.\nThe Finnish winger, 21, was one of Aberdeen's top performers during their impressive start to the season and has scored five goals since his summer arrival from HJK, also providing a couple of Premiership assists.\nKilmarnock play host to Aberdeen on Thursday, having lost 2-0 at Pittodrie back in August.\nFormer Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes' Killie side may have designs on the top six but Jimmy Thelin's Dons are in need of inspiration to get their season back on track and Keskinen is just the type of player that can stretch teams.\nAnd the winger could do with a strong start to 2025 too if he wants to force his way back into the Finland side, with their World Cup qualifying campaign starting in March.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvg71v0wxjeo"}
