As a defender, if the player is behind then you are going to try and stop the ball. You are not going to let it run through you.\n\"I said to the referee: 'Are you looking at that incident there?' He said they were. So if they were and then they gave it, I don't really understand.\n\"It is one of them. He didn't give offside, it's a bit disappointing but we can't do anything about it now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz6dj7nj5e2o"}
