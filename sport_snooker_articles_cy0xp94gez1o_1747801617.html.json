I'm going for my shots, and fancy them which is a good place to be.\"\nBoth Selby and Higgins are four-time world champions, and have met 24 times with the former having 16 victories to the Scot's eight.\nSelby, ranked third in the world, added: \"I've got so much respect for John as a player. He played phenomenally last night.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/articles/cy0xp94gez1o"}
