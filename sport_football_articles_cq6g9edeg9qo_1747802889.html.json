If we want success and to keep going through the leagues and keep being at the top of the division to complete, then we need to make sure that when we sign players they we will then have interest from other clubs because they will be performing that well.\"\nBut will Notts be able to hold out and keep Jatta at Meadow Lane to help in their quest for promotion?\n\"He is our player at the minute, but everyone does have a value,\" Maynard said.\n\"And that's the biggest thing, I can't say to you yes or no.\n\"He loves it at the football club, he comes in and works so hard every day and he will continue to do that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cq6g9edeg9qo"}
