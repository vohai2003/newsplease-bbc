We will try; hopefully we will be still in a position to attack something.\"\nVictory over fourth-placed Sunderland on Friday will see them go two points shy of Rohl's target, but the German is wary of the Black Cats' threat.\n\"They have good momentum, they have an exciting team. It is a long race, not just a sprint, you need to ready for 46 games.\n\"Every team has a period in the season where you lack some luck. This is football, the Championship.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cdell3jnlnyo"}
