Howard Primary School is not on the list.\nVoters who previously used the school will now be assigned to polling stations in Dungannon and Eglish.\nThe MP for Fermanagh South Tyrone, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle Gildernew, has welcomed the decision to close Moygashel polling station. The move has been criticised by the DUP's Lord Morrow.\nMs Gildernew said that the presence of a large number of hostile flag protestors outside the polling station in Moygashel on election day for the European election deterred many people from voting and exercising their democratic right.\nShe said she had expressed \"serious concerns\" to the commission following last year's loyalist protest.\nIn a statement, Mr Shields said: 'It is regrettable that electors from the Moygashel and Coolhill wards will be inconvenienced by having to travel further to cast their vote on polling day.\n\"However, my priority is to ensure that all voters, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to vote in a peaceful and safe environment.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-31051806"}
