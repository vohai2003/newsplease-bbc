But there is no going back and I have to look in the future. This will take time to process.\n“I’ve learned a lot throughout the years and had to sacrifice a lot. So this really hurts.\n“Eleven years at the academy of Club Bruges where I made a lot of friends. Two beautiful years with Brighton and a loan move to St Johnstone where I made my professional debut.\n“I want to thank all the players and staff that I have worked with.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crgne01g4rko"}
