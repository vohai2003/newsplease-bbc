The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.\nThe prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.\nHe welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.\nDodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.\nBut other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".\nLabour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.\nDodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.\nIn a post on X,, external Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I disagree with the PM on many things but on reducing the foreign aid budget to fund UK defence? He's absolutely right.\n\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\"\nHowever one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.\nHe suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.\nSir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation.\n\"It is a really difficult decision that was made but it was absolutely right the PM and cabinet endorse the PM's actions to spend more money on defence,\" she said.\nDodds first became a Labour MP in 2017 when she was elected to represent the Oxford East constituency.\nUnder Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party she served as a shadow Treasury minister and was promoted to shadow chancellor when Sir Keir took over.\nFollowing Labour's poor performance in the 2021 local elections, she was demoted to the women and equalities brief.\nSince July 2024, she has served as international development minister.\nDodds becomes the fourth minister to leave Starmer's government, following Louise Haigh, Tulip Siddiq and Andrew Gwynne.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpv44982jlgo"}
