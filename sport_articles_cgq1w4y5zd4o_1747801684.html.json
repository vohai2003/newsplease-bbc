We got in behind a couple of times as well.\n\"The second goal, comes from a set play, and the third goal was a bit of a mix up. Zach didn't have loads to do today but ultimately Celtic wear you down and if you make those mistakes you don't win here.\n\"They never give up, they went right to the end and we had some good opportunities. We created half chances, that's the difference in levels Celtic create half chances and they take them.\n\"The spirit and desire from the players I have no questions about. The fixtures coming now we believe we can get points out of and I believe we've represented ourselves well but been punished for errors by a very good side.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgq1w4y5zd4o"}
