Ross Laidlaw was out injured.\n\"He's come in, got his opportunity, he's taken it. I think he's performed really well. He's been really consistent.\n\"It's been over a short period of time. The challenge for him is to do that long-term.\n\"We've got someone else at the club in Ross Laidlaw, a very good goalkeeper, real experience, who's been a great servant for this club.\n\"For us to have two really good goalkeepers pushing each other for that spot, it bodes well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckgngl8zl08o"}
