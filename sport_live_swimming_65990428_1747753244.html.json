Ben Proud’s victory in the men’s 50m freestyle was the only golden moment for a team without the injured Adam Peaty.\nThis year, Peaty is missing once again but nonetheless GB have sent a 29-strong team to Japan and there are high hopes that they can deliver individual and relay success.\nThe Radio 5 live team comprises world champion Karen Pickering, Olympic medallist Steve Parry and leading commentator John Hunt.\nThey will bring you commentary of sessions of the finals, which start every day throughout the week at 1200UK, on a variety of platforms including 5 Live, Sports Extra and Online for UK listeners.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/swimming/65990428"}
