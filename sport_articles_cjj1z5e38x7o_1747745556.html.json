We want to put things in the right order. We know the responsibility we have when we represent Liverpool.\n\"Last season was nowhere near the levels we should have presented so of course we want to do different and we have that will to start from scratch and have a better season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cjj1z5e38x7o"}
