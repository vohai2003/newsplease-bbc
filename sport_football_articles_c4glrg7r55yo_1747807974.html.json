Six or seven times you see them spoon over the bar.\n\"When you play Everton, especially over the past few years, you know it's going to be a physical and tough game. You need a bit of quality to finish it off.\n\"It's not a game with a lot of clear-cut chances, but we took one and got the three points.\n\"Nobody really likes coming to play us here and, every home game, we go into it thinking we can win. We have to just keep our feet on the ground and keep plugging away game-by-game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4glrg7r55yo"}
