It is the reason they appointed Bompastor as Emma Hayes’ successor following her success with Lyon in Europe.\nIt was French giants Lyon who posed the biggest threat in Chelsea’s move for Girma, so it is a real coup for the Blues to have held them off and they needed a world record fee of £900,000 to do so.\nGirma adds quality and experience to a strong defensive unit at Chelsea. She also covers the loss of centre-back Kadeisha Buchanan, who is currently out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.\nWith Girma‘s arrival, Chelsea will be considered strong contenders for the Champions League, as well as favourites to win a sixth successive league title.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxkyyd0w5ro"}
