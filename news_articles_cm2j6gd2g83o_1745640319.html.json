Were they curious enough?\n\"We say the only conclusion based on the evidence is no.\"\nMr Maguire said that despite structures and processes at the Department of Health and Belfast Trust, it wasn't until CCTV in autumn 2017 that \"a culture of abuse in all its forms was uncovered\".\n\"But for CCTV, widespread abusive practices would have continued unabated at Muckamore,\" he said.\nHe called for redress for the patients and families affected by abuse at Muckamore.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2j6gd2g83o"}
