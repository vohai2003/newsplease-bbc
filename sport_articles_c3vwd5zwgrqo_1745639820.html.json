We can easily get nine points minimum to fuel the pursuit of European football.\nThe mess Aberdeen have found themselves in has benefited us massively and as long as their fall from grace continues we can profit.\nIt may be premature to start digging out my passport and beach towels for what will probably be Wales or Ireland away again, but as long as we are walking in a Wimmer wonderland, anything is possible.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c3vwd5zwgrqo"}
