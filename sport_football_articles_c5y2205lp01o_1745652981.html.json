His remit is to try and get that team in the play-offs.\"\nMcAnuff said similarities between Ismael's direct playing style and that of predecessor John Eustace might ease the transition.\n\"You know what he's all about, I look at the style of football, I think that's another tick.\n\"It's not somebody who is going to come in and change things dramatically from what John Eustace was doing â€“ it's a group of players that will understand roughly what he wants to do.\n\"It ticks a lot of boxes. Is it the most ambitious signing? No, but it makes sense. It fits within the framework of where Blackburn are right now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c5y2205lp01o"}
