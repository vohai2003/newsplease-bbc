Coming in and seeing the pictures of those who have done it before me, it feels surreal to be part of that history,\" Brown said.\n\"As a club, we're desperate to win the Championship. James Vince has been a tremendous leader, and will continue to be in the Blast, and hopefully I can continue our winning mentality as we continue to push for the four-day title.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c04nvvdx5k5o"}
