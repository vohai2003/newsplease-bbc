I have a lot of respect for Aberdeen and for Barry, since he took over they've been brilliant so we had to compete and match -up and I think we done that incredibly well.\n\"To come out of the game with a clean sheet, that's the most pleasing aspect for me.\n\"We had a couple of opportunities, but neither goalkeeper really had a proper save to make.\n\"It was a typical game of Scottish football.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cj7jp91x085o"}
