It is hard.\nThey had to strengthen in January and those players are really helping them as Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have found their form at a critical stage.\nI think this game will be good, exciting contest and Villa Park is always a difficult place to go too.\nVilla will need to find a way to break down Forest's stern defence if they are to get anything from it.\nThey have a busy few weeks ahead on three fronts so it is is hard to know what to prioritise, but Emery is known for winning cup competitions.\nIf I was a Villa fan then I would want to finish this season with a trophy and prioritising the FA Cup is the way I would go around doing that.\nPlus, that is a route into Europe.\nThey face Crystal Palace at Wembley and many will see that as a winnable game to progress to the final, where anything can then happen on the day.\nIf they are to beat Forest then Manchester City haven't shown themselves this season so anyone could beat anyone looking at these semi-finals.\nBut when you are in the Champions League still and it is two-legs in the quarter-final, you can fancy your chances on the day in that competition as well.\nPlus, Emery will try and compete in that, the FA Cup and the Premier League because he has the squad depth to do so.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czrv72ryp7xo"}
