The Dark Blues have won just one of their past 10 league games (D3 L6), and none of their past eight at home (D3 L5).\nSt Mirren's last four league games have all seen at least four goals scored (21 in total – 5.25 per game), with the Buddies scoring 10 and conceding 11 in this spell. Indeed, their 5-1 win over Kilmarnock last time out was the first time they scored five goals in a Premiership match since a 5-1 victory at Dundee United in January 2021.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cwy646x8rlgo"}
