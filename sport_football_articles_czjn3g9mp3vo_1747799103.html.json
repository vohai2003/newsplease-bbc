The first-half mentality and attitude is disappointing. It's about your mindset, and that is something that concerns me.\"\nFormer Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner, on Sportsound punditry duty, suggested it would be a \"real, real disappointment for the fans\" but what went wrong?\nRodgers gradually withdrew his starting front three of Nicolas Kuhn, Daizen Maeda and Jota in Perth and also replaced Â£11m signing Arne Engels at McDiarmid Park.\nBut their replacements could not make the difference either.\n\"The first half was poor,\" said Bonner. \"There was really no penetration. Did we see Maeda running in behind today? No.\n\"Kuhn was right off it. That's a bit of a worry for me. Jota did a bit but not enough.\n\"They did create enough chances in that second half at least to get a draw but they weren't able to put the ball in the back of the net.\"\nThe relative dip in Celtic's results in the second half of the season, having dropped just four points from August through December, is arguably down to their own consistency.\nWhen they were beaten for the first time domestically this season at Rangers on 2 January, the gap between the sides was reduced to 11 points.\nIt was hardly the re-igniting of a title race because there has never really been a title race this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czjn3g9mp3vo"}
