Really, probably not. I think if we pushed on, we could be much closer.\nI do not think it'll be the 42 points difference this season. I don't think Celtic will be as good as they were; Rangers probably also not as great.\n\"I would take third and a cup. Third gets us [European] group stages. A cup - we need a trophy, we've not had one in ages. And I would like to get out of our European group - if we're in the Conference it's much more likely. Maybe we get two cups - we'll have the quadruple!\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0dkgekyjzwo"}
