They will apply to athletes representing Great Britain or England at international events, including the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\"British Rowing is committed to promoting an environment in which rowing is accessible and inclusive and to ensuring that we provide opportunities and enjoyment for everyone,\" the governing body said.\n\"In order to achieve this in a fair manner, we need to establish conditions for competition that guarantee fair and meaningful competition by placing necessary and proportionate restrictions on eligibility.\"\nOrganisations including Fair Play for Women, Stonewall and Mermaids have been involved in the policy review since 2020, with the latest changes following consultation with more than 4,500 members of the organisations.\nThe eligibility policy update follows similar moves from other sports governing bodies, including World Athletics, British Cycling and swimming's Fina.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rowing/66393959"}
