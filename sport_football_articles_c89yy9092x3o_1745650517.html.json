He also set incredibly high standards (most of the time) that challenged those he would regard as more able players to follow.\nKeane has given Bruno Fernandes plenty of stick for his performances and the way he captains the current United team and waded in again yesterday in a fiery exchange with Ian Wright on the Stick to Football podcast.\nThe major problem is Fernandes is the best - and most creative - player in the current United squad.\nKeane feels United are underperforming. But expecting them to reach the standards he set is futile. They cannot do it.\nFormer manager Erik ten Hag defended Fernandes against Keane's criticism and now Ruben Amorim has done the same.\nWright had a point in his argument with Keane, asking where United would be without him.\nIf it is bad now, it would be worse if Fernandes was not at the club.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c89yy9092x3o"}
