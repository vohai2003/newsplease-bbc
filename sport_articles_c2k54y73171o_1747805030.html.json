I just want to win titles. So either it is the cup or the league - of course, the best would be both.\n\"I always set my dreams very high. But of course, we also need to look from game to game and get as much points as possible and then in the end we will see where we end up.\"\nSteinwender could make his debut against Dundee on Saturday and added: \"If the trainer calls me up, I'm ready.\n\"But I also came from Sweden where the season was ended in the end of November. I kept doing my programme, but you also need to know the other players, how they are acting on the field. You need to get to know everybody.\n\"It's only been, I think, two weeks now but I'm very excited to make my debut.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2k54y73171o"}
