He's gone into Manchester United and tried to change a whole culture. It's really encouraging how they got over the line against Arsenal.\n\"But the next three games they're at home - and the last time they were at Old Trafford, Newcastle could have had any amount of goals. They demolished them.\n\"This is going to be a different pressure. Manchester United have to control and dictate games better. The expectation will be there to do that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czx8r7revv0o"}
