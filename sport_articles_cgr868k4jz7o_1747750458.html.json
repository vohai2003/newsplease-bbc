One of the things I spoke to him about before he came was getting in the box more,\" the Blades boss told the club's official website.\n\"He probably feels like I'm getting on to him a bit, but I want him to understand what we want from that role. He's working his socks off.\n\"The games are the best place to practise it so it's important he gets feedback from this game.\"\nSheffield United complete their pre-season schedule when they host German side Stuttgart on 5 August (12:45 BST kick-off).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgr868k4jz7o"}
