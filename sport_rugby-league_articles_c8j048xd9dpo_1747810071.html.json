I thought we got our way back into the game and a real tough decision on the verge of half-time, a 12-point swing around with Gaz O'Brien's no try into Wakey's try, where it should have been 18-12 or 16-12 instead of 10-18.\n\"We weren't connected as a group for the whole game.\"\nWakefield Trinity head coach Daryl Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:\n\"I am obviously really pleased. It was a big performance from the boys. I think we're starting games well and I think it's taken a bit of time for us to get a handle on starting games well.\n\"They got pegged back a little bit, the momentum changed. I asked the boys what they thought of the game and they said they thought it was the toughest 40-point win they'd ever had.\n\"It was a close game in lots of ways and we play the same team again next week so they've got some motivation.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/c8j048xd9dpo"}
