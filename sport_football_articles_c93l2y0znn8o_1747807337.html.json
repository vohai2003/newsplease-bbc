Two different halves. First half we were better. Second half they pushed us more and we were defending more. Also we played the worst kind of football but we defended well.\n\"[Last season in the fifth round] we played against Leicester - they scored an amazing goal in extra time - and we couldn't play the quarter-finals. Let's see if we can go one step more. Playing in an FA Cup quarter -final would sound nice.\n\"It's still too early [to think about winning the FA Cup]. There will still be 15 other teams. Let's see what the draw says.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93l2y0znn8o"}
