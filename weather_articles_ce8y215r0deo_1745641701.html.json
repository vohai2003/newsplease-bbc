This will be on 14 March.\nThe Americas will have the best chance of viewing this total lunar eclipse as it will take place during their overnight period and will only be visible in dark skies.\nParts of the UK, away from the south-east, could notice some changes to the Moon's appearance as it starts to set in the early hours of the morning.\nIf you're in the Northern Hemisphere you'll have a chance of seeing this partial eclipse taking place on 29 March.\nThere won't be complete darkness but the Moon is going to pass in front of our view of the Sun covering around a third of it.\nIn the UK this event will start at around 10:00 GMT reaching its maximum coverage at around 11:00 GMT. It will be over by midday.\nWith the Sun at peak activity in its 11-year cycle, it's likely that there will be more sightings of aurora this year.\nWhile it can happen at any time of the day or year, the most crucial factor is darkness.\nAnd with rapidly increasing daylight hours throughout spring and therefore fewer hours of darkness, our chances of seeing the aurora become more limited.\nHowever, all is not lost as around the equinox in March, there can often be boost in sightings due to the Sun and Earth aligning in a way that allows more solar energy to enter our atmosphere.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/ce8y215r0deo"}
