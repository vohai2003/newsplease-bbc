I'm quite confident if we continue in this rhythm we should be able to stay in the league.\"\nMiquel felt Liverpool's sacking of manager Matt Beard on Thursday showed how difficult the WSL was. \"It is a hard league and ruthless league towards managers and also players,\" added Miquel. \"It is one of the best leagues and where everyone wants to be now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c74kkddn0l9o"}
