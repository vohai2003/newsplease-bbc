Since Glasner was appointed nearly a year ago, the striker has scored 21 league goals, only one fewer than Mohamed Salah of Liverpool in the same time.\nHowever, Palace did not create chances freely in this match and their best opportunities came when they were launching balls into the box to try to get level late on.\nOne positive was the impact of Â£14.5m signing Esse.\nThe 19-year-old scored just two minutes after coming on for his debut and Palace will be hoping that it is the start of a bright career.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cx2yq4l7dgpt"}
