That's just one example.\n\"If this was [about] efficiency we would be talking about improving standards, not about slashing over 1500 cleaning hours a week.\"\nAramark has entered into consultation with Nipsa and GMB trade unions and has shared documentation on their proposal to cut hours across the 162 sites.\nMr Wilson said \"it has been made clear\" that Aramark want to make \"changes\" before the contract is due to start on 1 April.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cedll20j6pwo"}
