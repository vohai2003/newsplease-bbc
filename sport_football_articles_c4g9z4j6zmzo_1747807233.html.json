Ignoring the cautious calls, he opted for a strong squad, signalling his intent to take the competition seriously.\nThat decision paid off, at least in the first half. Wolves treated their fans to 25 minutes of champagne football - a showcase of Premier League quality that Bristol City simply could not match. Wolves played some of their best football this season, with quick passing, sharp movement and attacking flair.\nYet, for all their dominance, Wolves failed to capitalise on all their chances, losing their flow and intensity - and the sense of control and assurance began to fade.\nIt highlighted a recurring issue - Wolves' inability to sustain their dominance over the full 90 minutes.\nIf Pereira wants to see his team push up the Premier League table and navigate cup ties successfully, he will need to focus on extending those periods of brilliance and instilling a ruthless, killer edge in front of goal.\nOne bright spark in the match was Rodrigo Gomes, who stood out with his energy, creativity, and potential. Once considered \"not ready\" for Premier League action under Gary O'Neil, Rodrigo now seems to be thriving under Pereira's guidance.\nComparisons with Pedro Neto have already begun. While their styles differ, Rodrigo's ceiling looks equally high.\nWolves' second-half dip was a stark reminder of the work still needed. Newcastle are next up in the league and one of the most in-form sides. Wolves will have to stretch that spell of brilliance into a consistent 90-minute display if they hope to secure any points.\nEvery victory sends a clear message: this team is capable of competing.\nSuccess in the FA Cup offers more than just progression. It also provides a valuable break from league pressures and can build momentum that fuels stronger performances in the Premier League.\nThe win over Bristol City highlights progress, but unlocking Wolves' full potential remains an ongoing challenge.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g9z4j6zmzo"}
