Then we might get the opportunity on the counter attack. But we defended a set piece badly and at 2-0 the game was killed.\n\"If this is a red card, then the one last week [Pape Gueye's challenge which went unpunished] in Aberdeen is a double red card. It's the same as last week, if there is a red card it's a different game.\n\"And the red card here kills the game as well. I can't understand the decision. Kofi wants to pass the ball, this is one movement, one swing. He has to clear the ball, so he has to swing.\n\"There's no movement, he's standing. For me, it's not a red card.\n\"I see the the guys in training and we need to bring that into the match. We don't have to always speak about top six, we also have an eye in the other direction, to be confident to get results now.\n\"It's difficult with 10 men so I can't blame the guys.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg72r7k84dpo"}
