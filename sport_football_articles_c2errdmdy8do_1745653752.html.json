Katy Hosford brought the Swans back level before Allen's late winner.\nLeague leaders Cardiff City were also in action on Wednesday night, with first half goals from Ffion Price and Mackenzie Olden enough to see off Aberystwyth Town in their 2-0 win.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c2errdmdy8do"}
