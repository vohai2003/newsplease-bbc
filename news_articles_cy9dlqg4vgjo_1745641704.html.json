Well, what is pleasing to one is unattractive to another - I'm not a fan.\"\nIrene Allison from North Lanarkshire had similar concerns.\n\"I cannot understand why you would even consider spending this money on this eyesore when people are struggling to heat (their homes) and feed their kids with rising costs for both,\" she said.\n\"Also councils have been deprived of funds and basic services are struggling due to lack of funding.\"\nIan Blois from Invernessshire was more worried about the appearance of the Star of Caledonia.\n\"Looks like something designed by an architect for a 1970s inner city revamp,\" he said.\n\"Wrong design for a rural setting. More suitable for a new town roundabout.\n\"The Angel of the North works because it reflects the industrial heritage of Newcastle and appears to have risen organically from the surrounding landscape.\"\nHowever, others approved of the way the project had been expanded to include more than just the artwork.\nJohn Bade from Kent said he found the design \"very attractive and very original\".\nHe thought that it was a \"good idea for the accompanying visitor centre to be added\".\nThere will still be time for the public to have its say as the project makes its way through the planning process.\nDumfries and Galloway Council will have to give the green light before the Star of Caledonia can hope to shine.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy9dlqg4vgjo"}
