That does two things.\nFirst, it releases someone from midfield to push further forward - I am guessing this will be Martin Odegaard.\nSecondly, it creates jeopardy for the defence in transition. William Saliba needs to be alert to this and Gabriel must cover Saliba. It also fills the middle of the pitch, so the wide players need to create passing angles.\nIn theory, given the players they have, this is a very exciting development for Arsenal.\nBut it requires a lot of work, which I am sure Mikel Arteta has been pushing his squad on during pre-season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ck5llexgjrdo"}
