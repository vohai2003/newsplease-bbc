But we do know it is going to keep him out for months rather than weeks,\" said boss Matt Taylor.\n\"I'm really disappointed for him because I know how hard he has worked.\n\"I am gutted for him because he has worked so hard to get in a position where he was competing for the first game of the season.\n\"At times football doesn't seem fair and this is one of those moments for George.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66310862"}
