The conditions were horrendous, more so for my players into the wind but it's not an excuse.\"\nAfter the European adventures at the start of the season, the campaign has gone from disappointing to dangerous as Kilmarnock start to slide towards the bottom.\nHowever, they were helped out by Rangers' late escapades against Dundee that ensured the league's 11th-placed side wouldn't gain any ground on Killie.\n\"I think we will [stay up], I think we're better than some teams in the league. I feel we've got bigger and better performances in us.\n\"Obviously, we're going to be in the bottom six, the only team that we play that won't be in and around us will be Celtic.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cd7v3z31nwxo"}
