He emerged instead with none.\nIt's also far from the first time Rangers have been exposed at the back. Jack Butland made another mistake and there were too many open spaces for Hibs' front men to expose, Martin Boyle in particular relishing the freedom for the second, decisive goal.\nThe Jekyll and Hyde season continues for Rangers.\nExcellent away from Ibrox lately, unconvincing in front of their own fans, and now with the unwanted distinction of being the first team in the history of the club to lose five in a row at Ibrox.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c367e62786do"}
