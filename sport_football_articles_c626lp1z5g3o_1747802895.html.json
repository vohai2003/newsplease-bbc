There was only one team that was on the pitch trying to win the game until we conceded that first goal that we gave them.\n\"We controlled the game and hit the crossbar. We showed the quality until then, but we have to keep the standards up throughout the game.\n\"We also had another one hit the crossbar from Raul Jimenez, and even with the mistakes we made in the first half, the result could have been completely different if we were clinical.\n\"In the second half, we knew we had to start strong and score early to come back and get a result. We did it and then we gave another goal away for them. We did everything much more than West Ham. We have been dominant like we are in all the games. But it didn't reflect at all in the result but this is the reality of the Premier League.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c626lp1z5g3o"}
