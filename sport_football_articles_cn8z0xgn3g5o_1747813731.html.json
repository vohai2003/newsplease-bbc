I was really pleased, bar the last action, the finishing was a bit off. I have to say David Raya played well.\"\n\"I can't ask anymore of the players, tough place to come. We probably weren't our best in the second half and that's what's probably has cost us the game.\"\nOn Alexander Isak's injury ruling him out of the final game of the season: \"It is too early to say. It is a strange one, as he felt it after training. Got a scan this morning to see what the damage was. Hopefully, he will be available, but we don't know.\"\nOn Champions League qualification: \"Halfway through the season we weren't in a great position.\n\"We worked hard to get here. I had the feeling it would go right to the end. It's an incredibly tight race. We have one more game to execute what we need.\"\nOn playing at home in the last game of the season: \"We love playing at home. It's a really great atmosphere. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves and make it too emotional.\n\"We need to give our best and try and win.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn8z0xgn3g5o"}
