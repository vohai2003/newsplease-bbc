That’s the key.\"\nHe always felt he had “unfinished business” when he left but is delighted to be back and relishing the expectation and pressure.\nHe is looking to strengthen the squad with further signings and has \"clear positions that are priorities we’ll look to improve on”.\nAnge Postecoglou did a “fantastic job” but Rodgers is looking to add tactical tweaks - “something new that’s different for opponents to think about”.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cq5yl2lyepwo"}
