The second half was different, we had the chances but we couldn't score. The first half was not good, we were not organised.\"\nOn the changes he made at half-time: \"We tried to find solutions. The boys showed a better game. It was one of the matches that we created the most in but didn't take anything from the game.\n\"When you lose, you don't recover so well. The miles come to your mind. It's always easy when you are in a good moment. Now it is not so good and it requires a bit of patience.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cze1p3wgepyo"}
