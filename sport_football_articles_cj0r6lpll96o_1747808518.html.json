I created a lot of the noise without meaning to,\" said Williams.\n\"There's been no contact from West Brom to me or my agent or the football club. There's been no contact at all.\n\"In fact, my agent has been quite unwell and been in bed for most of the Christmas period, then he phoned me up and said, 'What have you done? What's going on?'\n\"I'm pleased that's behind us. The players were excellent today. Certainly my group looked like they were unaffected by all the noise.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj0r6lpll96o"}
