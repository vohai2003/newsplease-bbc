But, looking back we could have won this one and the Swansea game too.\n\"Obviously losing Josh Maja was a blow but, if you want to win games, you have to score goals and we've missed too many chances.\n\"We haven't lost many games but we've had far too many draws. And that's something Tony Mowbray and his staff now have to work on.\n\"There's things he can take from this game. But he's a great manager and the club can only benefit from having him back here.\"\nStoke City boss Mark Robins told BBC Radio Stoke:\n\"I've got to be happy coming here and getting a point. You can tell what a good side they are and why they are up there at this end of the league.\n\"Going a goal up gave us a chance to build some momentum and we were good value for it. Nathan Lowe took his chance really well. I'm so pleased for him.\n\"He's come back full of confidence from scoring goals for Walsall â€“ and they've obviously done a good job with him. He's only 19 and he has so much potential.\n\"When we didn't score a second goal, you're always in danger of conceding and they were doing more attacking than us second half.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c334e67denlt"}
