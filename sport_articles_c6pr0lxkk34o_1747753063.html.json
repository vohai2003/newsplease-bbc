His manager said that he may be playing his way into his squad for next season.\n“Yes I am so happy with him. He is a player that can play in different positions. His quality, his understanding of the game, he is a clever player. I am so happy with him so far,\" said Pochettino.\n“So far he is in my plans. I am so pleased because he is a player whose attitude, commitment and understanding of the game we can use in different positions. That is a good thing for the team and for a coach. It is good to have this type of player.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c6pr0lxkk34o"}
