Training has been good, it’s been tough, like I expected.\n\"We need to get up to speed, especially the ones who came in late, as quick as we can, so we’re ready for the new season.\n“Every time I step on the pitch, I have to give a good account of myself. I know I’m good enough to play in the team, so every time I step over that white line, I give everything to put in good performances.\n“Hopefully the manager has a decision to make for the first game of the season.”", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cqvyy722v73o"}
