His previous highest appearance tally was 26 games in League One last term.\nKeenan Patten is also fit again, with Jardim saying it feels the squad are approaching \"full power\" with the return of the three injury lay-offs.\nStriker Hudlin is back from the calf injury suffered against Carlisle in February, Jameson is training after a quad tear at the start of the month while 21-year-old Davies returns having been ruled out for the season with a hamstring injury in January.\n\"They gave a big effort and it was good to see them running about and nice to see them back,\" added Jardim. \"There was a good energy in the session because they brought that back to the squad.\"\nAfter defeat on the road, Newport are hoping to make it three home wins in a row when the sixth-placed Magpies arrive at Rodney Parade.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxnvqeqn81o"}
