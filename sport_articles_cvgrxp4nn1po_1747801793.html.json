I would have liked to have taken more control. In the first half we got into good areas without producing the final bit.\n\"In the second half I would've liked to see us pass the ball a bit better and control the game with possession. But it's a moment of quality from Penners - a fantastic volley and great strike.\n\"We have to try to improve the quality all over the pitch. In the last little bit, the final third, in the last couple of games, with more composure and quality 1-0 becomes 2-0.\n\"It's the first time we've had back-to-back league wins which gives us a lift and keeps us moving in the direction we want to. It's very tight in the league and we have to keep performing the way we did today.\"\nOn Kye Rowles potentially leaving this month, Critchley said: \"We've been approached by another club and negotiations are taking place. Nothing's agreed at this moment in time so he is still our player and will remain our player until the valuation is met.\"\nCritchley adds he hope to have new forward signing Elton Kabangu available for the Aberdeen game.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvgrxp4nn1po"}
