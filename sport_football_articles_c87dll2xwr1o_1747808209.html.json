We look at what we have in the squad, what we are lacking and who can bring something that potentially can make us much better. Regardless of age or the background they have, [there has to be] a real belief that the player can be really good for us.\"\nOn how important a victory could be for Arsenal's Premier League title aspirations: \"It will be a big boost for us. Winning big matches is always something special and every time you play a big match against your big rivals, it brings something extra.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c87dll2xwr1o"}
