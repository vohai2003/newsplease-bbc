There were moments where we got into the final third [in the] first half, second half was like we just tired out of the game.\n\"I just feel we need to regroup, freshen up, freshen the squad up a bit. We lost too many tackles, made some crazy decisions and definitely didn't do enough to deserve a win.\n\"To concede off a set-piece was really disappointing.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3rq5d22gxeo"}
