You have to take your chances and, if you don't, it's never over. To concede that goal, right at the end, is very frustrating.\n\"I'm very happy to be improving my football. I've felt good since day one here and the staff and players have welcomed me. I just have to show 100% on the pitch.\n\"There is still a long way to go this season. Today was frustrating but we move on and learn from it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c24nj47z8g1o"}
