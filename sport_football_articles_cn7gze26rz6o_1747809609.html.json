Ref who was closest to the action didn't blow for an infringement, linesman never raised flag for offside, presumably fourth official communicated through earpiece- what does he spot from the halfway line that the ref and linesman combined don't see? Embarrassing officiating.\nLewy: The \"ghost\" goal at Derby was a shambles in the way it was dealt with. The linesman didn't raise his flag at anytime during the build up, the actual goal or afterwards, disgraceful really.\nChris: The officials were caught napping - definitely not offside.\nAndy: An explanation is needed from the officials to how they came to that decision.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn7gze26rz6o"}
