I'm more disappointed in our reaction after going 1-0 down,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\"The goal was an action we can avoid, but it took us more than 30 minutes to react and start to build up the pitch and put them under pressure.\n\"We lost a little bit of our identity in these moments. I'm disappointed because I expect my team to come back quicker and put the opposition on the back foot and under pressure a bit more.\"\nThe result now leaves Hull in 20th and only three points clear of the drop zone with seven matches to play.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd6jyywzz2vo"}
