So if we can achieve that it would be great,\" Arteta said.\nInjuries have been an issue this season for Arsenal and they welcomed back Ethan Nwaneri and Riccardo Calafiori to the squad after a period out.\nHowever, Myles Lewis-Skelly missed the Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb with a jarred knee and is set to undergo a scan on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce8y18v0y75o"}
