If a club comes along then that's an interesting opportunity for him.\n\"For us, we were only going to be interested in selling him if there was a transfer fee that did justice to his qualities. And, of course, from my side, you then ask if you can reinvest that, because his contribution to the title was very big.''", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckmkl5rrz06o"}
