Lauren's the champion who's never lost a round. The Olympic gold medallist,\" Jonas said.\n\"There is a lot of pressure on her to come and do what she says she can do. Being underdog suits me. I've been here before. It's not something that's new. I always come out shining.\"\nThe two rivals met at a news conference at London's Dorchester hotel for the first time since their fight was announced following their successful world title defences in December.\nThe needle in their first staredown was less prevalent on Tuesday despite facing off before and after the news conference, which was twice interrupted by the ringing phone of Jonas' coach Joe Gallagher.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cjdexvne189o"}
