The trust can still do the right thing to prevent the disruption this strike will cause.\"\nCaroline Hayhurst, a phlebotomist at Cheltenham General Hospital, said it was time \"our pay and grading reflected the responsibilities of the role\".\n\"I do this job because I love it, but it's getting harder and harder to pay the bills,\" Ms Hayhurst said.\n\"Few people realise the skills and experience it takes to be a phlebotomist until they need one.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz613egnpneo"}
