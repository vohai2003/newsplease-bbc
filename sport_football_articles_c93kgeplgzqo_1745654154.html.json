With James Hill having to drop into centre-back and Lewis Cook retreating in a right-back role, it felt like a familiar tale of adapting from a side that allowed us to play our A game.\nDespite the rejigging, with Matheus Cunha notching for Vitor Pereira's men five minutes later, there was always the feeling that it would be an uphill struggle for Andoni Iraola's side, not least because of Wolves' canny way of breaking up play and stopping teams from playing the football they want to.\nIt feels quite a significant moment in the season to lose such a key cog in Bournemouth's defence. Assuming it is not overturned on appeal, there will be some juggling to do once more.\nThe good news is that Andoni has a habit of forging out results when least expected, and while Brighton are going to be a significant test, fans are expecting a reaction after a sub-par performance against Wolves.\nWith Evanilson being a surprise inclusion on the bench at the weekend, the hope is that his return can spark the potency up top that was missing, and then maybe we can give Brighton as much concern as they will inevitably give us.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c93kgeplgzqo"}
