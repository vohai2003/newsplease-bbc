Kerr accepts that come the summer the decision is in Olusanya's hands when his deal expires.\nKerr says that Mikael Mandron and Olusanya have \"everything\" you could want from a striking duo, adding they \"would put fear into any manager\".\nKerr wants St Mirren to capitalise on last week's win over Aberdeen given the tight nature of the Premiership table.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cqldk4xzz94o"}
