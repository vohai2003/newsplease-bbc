Danny Wilson headed Hearts in front early in the second half, a lead that they held until time added on.\nNicky Law equalised for Rangers with the 90 minutes up, but Osman Sow drove through the Rangers defence and hammered Hearts back in front just a minute later to win the game.\nThe Jambos get their latest campaign under way away to St Johnstone on Saturday (15:00 BST), looking to emulate those past successes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c6pvvkvg4l2o"}
