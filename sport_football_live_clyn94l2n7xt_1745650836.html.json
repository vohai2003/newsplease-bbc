Mistakes weigh heavier under such conditions,\" Conceicao told DAZN.\n\"I was a player, I know when it's like that, your boots feel like they're burning. When a dribble or a pass doesn't work or you're behind, it burns even more.\"\nMattia Zaccagni put Lazio ahead in the first half but Samuel Chukwueze's scored a later equaliser for the hosts after a Strahinja Pavlovic red card.\nHowever, former Chelsea forward Pedro netted the winner for the visitors from the penalty spot in the eighth minute of stoppage time.\n\"It is not an easy moment,\" added Conceicao. \"The players feel the tension around the club.\n\"The only way forward is to work hard, take pride in our colours and strive to change the situation.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/clyn94l2n7xt"}
