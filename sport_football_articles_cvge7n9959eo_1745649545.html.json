The Magpies have also been eliminated from each of their last five FA Cup ties against the Seagulls.\nBrighton have beaten Newcastle twice at St. James' Park this season, after winning 1-0 in Premier League. They are just the fourth team to win twice away to the Magpies in the same campaign in the Premier League era, after Manchester City in 2013-14, Hull City in 2008-09 and Liverpool in 1997-98.\nAnthony Gordon is the first Newcastle United player to receive a red card in the FA Cup since Shola Ameobi in the 2012-13 third round, which also came against Brighton.\nThis was the first FA Cup tie between two Premier League clubs that has seen both teams have a man sent off since Everton v Chelsea in the 2015-16 quarter-finals (Gareth Barry and Diego Costa).", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvge7n9959eo"}
