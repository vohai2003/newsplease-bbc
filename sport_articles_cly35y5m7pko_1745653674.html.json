We were in total control of the game, but we have two individual errors in the second half, and credit to Hearts, they punished us.\n\"From there, we created chances and missed them, and got done on the counter. Performance-wise, it was very good. To come here and take the game to them was pleasing. The individual errors, you can't control.\n\"I wasn't too hard on the players in there, any points from these three games were a bonus for us and it's very much still all to play for.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cly35y5m7pko"}
