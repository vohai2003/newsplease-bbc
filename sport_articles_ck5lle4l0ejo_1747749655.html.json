But anyway, it is a good thing I am not negotiating. I just take care of the coaching.\"\nIt remains possible Raya will stay in west London, and Frank says he would be perfectly happy with that situation.\n\"We all want as many good players as possible and competition,\" he said. \"If he stays, then we have two very good keepers.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ck5lle4l0ejo"}
