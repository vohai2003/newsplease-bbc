The Owls haven't lost four in a row at home since December 2012.\nHull won 3-0 away at Sheffield United earlier this campaign but have never previously won away at both Sheffield clubs in a league season. The last side to beat both by three or more goals away from home in one season was Huddersfield Town in 1953-54 (6-3 at United, 4-1 at Wednesday).\nSheffield Wednesday's Barry Bannan has four assists in his last 10 Championship appearances and since 2015-16, only Jed Wallace (56) and John Swift (48) have more assists in the competition than the Scotsman (44).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cq80q0g5j1qo"}
