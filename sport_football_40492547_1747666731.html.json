As with any other coach, I want to get as far as I can â€¦ in fact I want to win the final.\"\nThe squad that Chidzambwa is in charge of take on Lesotho in the semi-finals of the Cosafa Cup in Moruleng, South Africa on Wednesday.\nChidzambwa has won the tournament twice before as coach and has an unbeaten record in the Cosafa Cup.\nThe country, whose cash-strapped football association has been the subject of frequent court sequestration bids and previously had property seized to pay outstanding debts.\nMapeza took over as caretaker coach for the start of the 2019 Nations Cup qualifiers, where the Warriors, with a team filled with foreign-based players, began their bid to qualify for the next tournament in Cameroon with an impressive 3-0 win over Liberia.\nThe next Nations Cup qualifier for Zimbabwe is in March next year against the Congo in Brazzaville.\nChidzambwa was in Zimbabwe's first post-independence team in 1980 and coached the national team first in 1995.\nHe had a permanent spell from in 2002 to 2004, after which Gumbo took over from him, and returned again in 2009 after Jose Valinhos left.\nGumbo's spells in charge came in 2005 and 2012 he is now preparing to play Namibia on 16 July in the CHAN qualifiers with the second leg set for the following weekend.\nShould they progress, they will meet either the Comoros Islands or Lesotho over two legs in August for a place in next January's finals in Kenya.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40492547"}
