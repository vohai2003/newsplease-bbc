He knows where the goals are and he is playing in a team that is creating chances, so he will probably score goals. He knows where to be and what to do in the final third.\n\"You would probably have to replace Isak with Wilson to keep that experience up top when the chances do come along.\n\"Nine times out of 10, Wilson is probably going to put it in the back of the net.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3ev1pl5y0eo"}
