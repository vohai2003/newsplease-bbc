Football wants to be an ideal bridge for sharing passions and emotions related to sport.\"\nEuropean football's governing body says it will work with both the Turkish and Italian federations to \"ensure that the documentation to be submitted for their joint bid is compliant with the bidding requirements.\n\"If the joint bid does comply with such requirements, it will be submitted to the UEFA Executive Committee at the meeting scheduled on 10 October, where the appointments for 2028 and 2032 will be made. Decisions on venues and match schedules will be made at a later stage,\" Uefa said.\nTurkey's hosted June's Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan at Istanbul's Atat√ºrk Olympic Stadium, but a major international tournament has never been in the country.\nReigning European champions Italy hosted the Euros in 1968 and 1980 and Rome's Stadio Olimpico was also used as a venue at Euro 2020.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66338138"}
