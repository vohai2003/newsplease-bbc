On came Watkins, who came off again after the hour mark, running on empty.\nThat was the case for plenty of the Kilmarnock players, despite the four changes. They barely laid a glove on County in the first half, with not a single shot on target.\nThat has been the problem too often this season. They have failed to score in eight of their 22 games and rarely looked threatening today.\nKilmarnock have been able to come back after going behind this season, winning twice on such occasions, but that has not happened at home. Rugby Park has become pregnable and McInnes can no longer rely on good home form to keep them away from danger.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg52je0p2q3o"}
