The two men have made 73 headed clearances each, a stat that proves their value when it comes to defending dead balls.\nMurillo - fresh from his contract extension at Nottingham Forest - was highlighted in recent weeks for a no-nonsense display against Liverpool, when he frequently launched clearances into the night. He makes the top three across these metrics and while Brazilian players are so often lauded for their flair, he can proudly carry the 'loves-to-defend' tag.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9vmgvjj97wo"}
