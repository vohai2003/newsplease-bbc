I think once a player expresses a desire to leave and try to go on to a move that was the right one for her, I think we have to look at what the best offer was.\n\"Arsenal made the best offer so it was a simple one for us.\"\nKelly will not be available to play against her parent club when City host Arsenal in the WSL on Sunday (12:00 GMT kick-off).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgmrzp8x1po"}
