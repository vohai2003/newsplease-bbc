Then we go ahead again, switch off, concede, and miss a few good chances.\nI'm glad the season is over and glad to see the club backing John Brown, external as well over his strong criticism on Rangers TV of refereeing standards. It's about time the club stood up for itself.\nBarry Ferguson is leaving and so too is Leon Balogun. Hopefully it's the start of a sweeping change at the club.\nThis season will be consigned to the bin very quickly. We will learn nothing analysing it or going over the wrongdoings of managers and board members along the way.\nLet's just be thankful it's over and hopefully we have more positive times just around the corner.\nThere is a lot of work to be done for whoever the new manager will be. There should be a massive turnover of staff but the one thing I am hoping for as a fan is a transfer strategy that builds a spine of the team that can handle the pressure and intensity of being a Rangers player.\nLet's see what the summer brings.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2kqq5vnykko"}
