Rob Atkinson looked good after coming off the bench for his debut.\nThey had their chances on the break but were not as clinical as they needed to be in front of goal.\nThe home form has been excellent but it is now four losses in a row on the road.\nPortsmouth cannot rely exclusively on their home form to keep them out of the bottom three.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyve30mvepo"}
