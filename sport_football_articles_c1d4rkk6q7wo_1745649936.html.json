I want to play minutes, I work hard every day to do that, and I got the opportunity today - but not in the best circumstance.\n\"I felt good. I knew it was going to be a tough game. I had to stay patient and, when the moment came, I had to be ready to take it.\n\"I pride myself on working hard every day. I'm ready and hopefully more opportunities will come. I just want to be out there and to help the team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1d4rkk6q7wo"}
