He is with us and it is a pleasure to have him around. He has experience and, with the way he goes about things... he is a really good person to have around. I am very happy.\n\"Wayne had a serious injury at the end of last season, to his Achilles. It was a tough moment for everyone but he is a big part of things for us, within the small group that is our goalkeeper community.\n\"He helps Matz Sels, [Carlos] Miguel and Aaron with their work. Aaron, unfortunately, is going to be out for two or three months with a knee injury.\n\"I call the small group of goalkeepers the 'society'. Wayne is a big part of that community.\n\"We have to finish the end of the transfer window. We might need him. We will see if there is a place in the 25 for him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvge47d3l5zo"}
