There's no way I'm accepting that.\n\"I thought we started on the front foot before Hibs got the first goal. Another mistake from us. I said at half-time I need to see more, I want to see more aggression in our play and I never saw it. That's the thing I'm raging with.\n\"I'm not going to kid anybody on. Hibs deserved it. They tackled harder, ran harder and wanted it more. It's sore for me to say that.\n\"I'll take the responsibility. I pick the team and I need to go away with the players and have a long hard look in the mirror.\n\"This [season] is in real danger of just petering out. It's about pride. I know we're in the Europa League, but those are easy games to get up for.\n\"I will make changes, I'm not scared to make changes. I need a team that's willing to put their bodies on the line.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ce3v23543k0o"}
