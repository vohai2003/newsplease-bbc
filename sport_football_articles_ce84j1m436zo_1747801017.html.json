I don't think it's a penalty, [it was] really soft so disappointed we haven't got three but I don't think the performance deserved three so we'll take the point and move on,\" Heckingbottom told BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\"Start of the second half they got on top. I felt they won all the duels and we're going to face teams that are fighting to stay in the league.\n\"Cardiff, Plymouth, Hull away that's what we're going to face so really disappointed with that spell of the game and we weren't good enough to take the sting out of it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce84j1m436zo"}
