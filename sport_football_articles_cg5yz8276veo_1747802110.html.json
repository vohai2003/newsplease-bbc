It was a good physical game of football from both sides. No dark arts, just one team wanting it much more than the other.\nRonan: He's not wrong and it has been a weak point of Stoke's game all season, but it was a total failure by the referee to control the game in my opinion.\nThe standard of refereeing in this season's Championship has been diabolical - I dread to count the number of points we have lost to objectively incorrect refereeing decisions.\nI confess I watch the Prem with envy every time the referee runs over to that monitorâ€¦\nDarren: Robins need to worry about his own team being pretty poor, and how he is going to stop their slide down the table, rather than making excuses for the defeat. Pompey had 9 fouls against them, Stoke 12... Hmmm.\nAdrian: Sounds like sour grapes to me. I never saw anything other than a normal game of modern football from both sides.\nExpect better from Robins. Maybe the pressure of the position he finds himself in now is dawning on him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg5yz8276veo"}
