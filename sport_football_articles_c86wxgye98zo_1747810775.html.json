He'd be more than happy to play - he's here to play.\"\nWhoever plays in goal against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday (12:30 GMT) will hope for a quieter afternoon than Vigouroux endured at Portsmouth in midweek, when Swansea suffered their heaviest defeat of the season.\nThey will attempt to find a response against an Albion side who remain firmly in play-off contention despite losing boss Carlos Corberan to Valencia over Christmas.\n\"They're a very good side, very well organised,\" Williams added.\n\"They have a very capable squad. There's no question it will be a very difficult game for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c86wxgye98zo"}
