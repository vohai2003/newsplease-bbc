We're still in a great position.\"\nVidosic wants his side to be persistent with his brand of football and not let standards slip against difficult opponents.\nHe added: \"I don't really want to just sit back and hope. We want to go there, we want to try to play our football. It's hard to sometimes build something when if Chelsea come we go 'we're going to play a different style of football.'\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cjw22ew947do"}
