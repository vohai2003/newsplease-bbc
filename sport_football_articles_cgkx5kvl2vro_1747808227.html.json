How Tom Davies has played 90 minutes I'll never know.\n\"The effort and character of the boys when we are up against it. It was fine margins against Burnley, West Brom and Sunderland, Watford have a good home record.\"\nWilder also called on his team to continue in this vein in order to secure an immediate Premier League return.\nHe said: \"We have to use this. The supporters were incredible today - they recognised the boys were running on empty. We couldn't shake things up.\n\"Too much is made about style and performance. You've got to want to win. They deserved that win - the players and supporters.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgkx5kvl2vro"}
