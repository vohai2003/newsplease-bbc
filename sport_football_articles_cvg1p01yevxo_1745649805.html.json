I felt, second half, Middlesbrough didn't cause us any problems, and the manner we conceded the goal wasn't good enough,\" he told BBC Radio Derby.\n\"It's tough job, it is what it is, but I'm here to help, I'm here to progress the club.\n\"I thought, first half, we had a couple of real good chances on the break and our final pass wasn't good enough.\n\"It's stuff that we've been working on in the last couple of weeks, so that will come, that will keep improving.\n\"I was really pleased with the group again, the attitude was fantastic and just very disappointed that we lost.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvg1p01yevxo"}
