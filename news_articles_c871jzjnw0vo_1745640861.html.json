It's going to take time to turn things around.\"\nIn a statement the council said that due to safeguarding and data protection it could not comment on individual cases.\nIt said: \"We care deeply about improving the lives of children and young people and supporting them, along with their families, to thrive.\"\nResponding to the statement, Ralph said: \"For Henry, there's been no improvement at all - he's just accepted collateral damage.\"\nHenry's mother Rachel added: \"Who is thinking about Henry here? There might be rules and regulations but really, what's best for Henry?\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c871jzjnw0vo"}
