Nonetheless, it is disappointing and caused delays and increase in costs for young people,\" Mr Macarthur said.\n\"There's young people looking for apprenticeships now and this will delay things by a year.\"\nCampaigner Martin Berkeley, who was hoping the Amulet theatre in Shepton Mallet could reopen, said: \"It is very disappointing because it would have made a huge difference to Shepton Mallet.\n\"Because we put so much work into the funding bid, we are in a great position to put our project for the new round of funding.\n\"All these things take a very long time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly24zlvg6do"}
