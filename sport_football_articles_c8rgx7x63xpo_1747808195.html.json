Beating Brighton in the FA Cup is a fantastic bonus that they can add on to an already sensational season. I think nine out of 10 Forest fans will pick Champions League qualification over the FA Cup.\"\nForest will face Manchester City at Wembley for a place in the FA Cup final, while remaining five points clear of Chelsea who are occupying fourth in the Premier League table.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8rgx7x63xpo"}
