I didn't make him available for the game and I think the situation is progressing and what I wouldn't do is put that at risk at this stage.\n\"If that changes then Romain will be back in the squad.\"\nWhen asked if Esse's proposed move to Palace was more likely than it had been last week, Neil added: \"Yeah, I think that's fair to say.\"\nHe has scored five goals and provided one assist in 25 games in all competitions for Millwall this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyw1xgvy9lo"}
