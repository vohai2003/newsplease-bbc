According to the force, six people were taken to hospital - all but one have been discharged since.\nThere have been no arrests, and inquiries are ongoing.\nDet Ch Insp Chris Soole said: \"We continue to work alongside our partners, including the local council and health professionals, to establish the full circumstances â€“ in particular to confirm that the drugs are the cause of these people being taken ill and to identify anyone else who may have been affected.\"\nThe Met also issued a warning against buying and consuming illegal drugs.\n\"They are illegal and the trade is not regulated, so there are always very serious risks associated with taking these substances,\" the force said.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2gjnjelmzo"}
