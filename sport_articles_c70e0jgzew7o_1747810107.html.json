We got the scores that we needed by half-time.\n\"It was always going to be difficult playing into a strong wind in the second half. Probably not a perfect performance, but our disciplined defence kept them out.\n\"That's the Paddy [Harrison] we know. He certainly adds impact and obviously Darcy Graham's individual brilliance was outstanding.\n\"Every five points you get is going to help the cause. We need to focus on every game and try to win them all.\n\"Our kicking game was good, we put them under pressure and when teams kick at us we're really dangerous.\n\"Dragons are proud and they've got a lot to fight for. The guys did really well to keep them down to one try. Happy with our defence and our discipline.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c70e0jgzew7o"}
