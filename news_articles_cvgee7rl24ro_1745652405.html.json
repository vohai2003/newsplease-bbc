Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"\nBut the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.\nSir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".\nAsked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"\nBut he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".\nSuch a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".\nSir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".\nTrump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.\nThe UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.\nThe agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.\nBut during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".\nAt the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"\nAsked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".\nThat led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".\nHe rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgee7rl24ro"}
