A proven goalscorer in Scotland and Europe. He’s still looking for a club apparently, so no transfer required! Beggars can’t be choosers!\nEddie: Please, Everton board, give Sean Dyche some decent money to buy a striker! Keep it a secret from the Everton technical department because they are useless. Please buy someone who is closer to 18 than 60 for a change!\nSteve: We need to table a bid for Boulaye Dia of Salernitana. We need to offer them cash plus Maupay, as their chairman has wanted him for ages. It's a win-win situation.\nJohn: El Bilal Toure is looking doubtful now, so I'd like to see us go for Boulaye Dia. But only if we don't get Toure.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c72w97lx5weo"}
