His impressive performance against Ipswich Town brimmed with creativity, courage and perseverance. No room for doubt or time for haters here, this is the reward of years of hard work and learning the lessons â€“ even when some teachers deliberately make it difficult.\nIn fact, Spence's own redemption arc could turn out to be a perfect prelude for the wider team's salvation this season. After all, there are still prizes left to play for.\nAlthough it is tempting to think the league is insignificant now, it is more than worth keeping an eye on because a European football spot could be secured for next season.\nWe have an extremely healthy goal difference compared to a lot of teams around us and, as our players returning from injury, other teams are starting to suffer from losing theirs. A late surge up the table is more than possible.\nMore excitingly though, and perhaps more importantly for the future of this manager and his team, is the prospect of lifting the Europa League trophy in May.\nNo competition at this level is ever easy, but looking at the teams left in the Europa League, we have to believe we can beat them. We certainly have to try.\nSo yes, Spurs are daring me to dream. In turn, I am daring Spurs to do.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c93n8jx53q3o"}
