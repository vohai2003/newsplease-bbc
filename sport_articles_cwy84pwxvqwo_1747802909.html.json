You give up a bit of possession, stick with that back five and keep our midfielders doing the running rather than the full-backs jumping, and we got in 2-1 at half-time, which was huge.\n\"For the effort and character shown in the second half, I think we at least deserve a point.\n\"We should probably have gone 3-2 up. Miller hits the post, Gayle had a good chance. To get pegged back and come again shows massive character.\n\"There are a lot of things to still work on, when you look at how we started the game and conceding three goals, but full credit to the players for the effort and desire shown.\n\"All in all we're in a good place. Confidence is high and we need to keep moving forward.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cwy84pwxvqwo"}
