It's a massive step.\n\"We're very close to achieving the goal we had before the group stage started.\"\nOn the collective ambition for goals: \"Yes, I'm happy. We generated quite a lot [of chances]. Declan [Rice] especially, but he missed a few big chances, and really good from Martin [Odegaard]. His first goal [and] he really needed that.\n\"You could tell by the way he celebrated that he had an anger and a desire to do it, so overall a really positive night.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj65rw4lwnno"}
