A long ball forward was won by Andy Dallas, who teed up the striker to beat Connor Ripley with a cool finish from eight yards out.\nDallas went close to adding a second in the 44th minute when the ball fell to him on the left hand side of the area but he could only volley wide of the target.\nSwindon's best chance came after 68 minutes when Paul Glatzel produced the perfect cross for Harry Smith but the striker could only head straight at Harry Burgoyne.\nThe Morecambe keeper was on hand again to keep out the Robins when he made a fine double save from Tom Nichols and Botan Ameen, and then clawed away a long-range effort from Nnamdi Ofoborh that was heading for the bottom right corner.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ce306065d12t"}
