Two very important players going down.\n\"Hopefully they're all right. I think they're both OK but I'm not sure.\"\nOn the difference between the two sides: \"The boys hung in there but we're obviously disappointed with the result in the end.\n\"The difference was probably their clinicalness in the finish zone. We had a few opportunities, showing a little bit, but not taking them or converting them into scores.\"\nOn preparations for England next up: \"Initially with the week off, get some time away. That's a sore loss we've to take on the chin.\n\"But by the time we come back into camp, make sure that we're ready to go.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgj2xj9p5d9o"}
