Once we did that, it was a big relaxing moment to go to Wembley just to enjoy.\"\nRideout's strike partner Graham Stuart added: \"We turned up at Wembley knowing we were the underdogs, but we didn't feel it in our dressing room.\n\"You're never going to play Manchester United and dominate for 90 minutes. They're too good of a side and there's too many talented players. But when we needed the Neville Southalls and Dave Watsons and the Barry Hornes, they stood up for us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp91l7537lmo"}
