We start the game really well and they score more or less the first time they arrive in our box.\n\"Sometimes teams can react in another way, but it was nice to see the reaction that the team game. The response was really good.\n\"We have some injuries but the squad is growing, and players are developing. It's not so much about football sometimes, but about responsibility. [Leighton] Clarkson's performance today was really good to see.\n\"We see players getting better and better - even Alfie [Dorrington] has grown since he arrived [in January]. It's created healthy competition inside the squad. Graeme Shinnie at left-back was really strong today.\n\"I like the way the team is growing. We need the squad to be good through the season. We need to use the whole squad the whole way.\n\"Nothing has changed, but it is good to be top six. We can only take it game by game, we have another difficult game away next weekend to prepare for.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crknky74rgeo"}
