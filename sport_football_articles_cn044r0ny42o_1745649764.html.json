Even though they beat Ipswich on Wednesday, they did not half make hard work of it and the Tractor Boys ran them close at Old Trafford.\nAlejandro Garnacho appeared to have a bit of a hissy fit after being hooked before half-time, so it will be interesting to see how Ruben Amorim deals with that. He will not have any players left at this rate if he decides to leave Garnacho out.\nUnited are the FA Cup holders and they have beaten Fulham home and away already this season, but on both occasions it was far from convincing, and I don't really care about that anyway.\nAmorim is a likeable guy, and I have got sympathy for him about the size of his task at Old Trafford but, from watching United, I cannot think of any reason to back them to win this.\nI am usually wrong about Fulham, but they are going to take this one - 100%.\nSutton's prediction: 0-3\nWatch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cn044r0ny42o"}
