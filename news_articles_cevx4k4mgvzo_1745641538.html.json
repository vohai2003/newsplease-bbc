She was very bad around other dogs.\"\nIt was then the work began. Jessica watched a raft of online videos and training began in earnest.\n\"I have always liked watching agility, but it seemed so out of reach and I didn't think Zola would be the dog for it.\n\"We started agility training two years ago â€“ it's been a long and hard journey with a lot of set backs,\" said Jessica.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevx4k4mgvzo"}
