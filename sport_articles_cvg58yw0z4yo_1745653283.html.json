And they have achieved the first part of that.\nAfter back-to-back defeats, the victory over County will have everybody at McDiarmid Park feeling a bit better about themselves.\nValakari's side remain bottom of the table and they still have plenty of work to do, but if they can back this victory up with another at Dens Park on Sunday, the Perth side will definitely believe they can pull off a relegation great escape.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cvg58yw0z4yo"}
