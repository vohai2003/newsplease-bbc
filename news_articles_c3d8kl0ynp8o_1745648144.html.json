A decision is due be made on Thursday.\nSusan Hinchcliffe, leader of the council, said the tax was currently Â£145 below the national average for metropolitan district councils and the lowest in West Yorkshire.\nIsmail Uddin, an independent councillor, said many people in the city would \"not be able to afford an increase\".\nEchoing the councillor's sentiments, Rob Hoveman, one of the protesters, said: \"That is the highest council tax rise in the country, it's way ahead of inflation.\n\"We think this rise is absurd and should have been resisted by the council.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3d8kl0ynp8o"}
