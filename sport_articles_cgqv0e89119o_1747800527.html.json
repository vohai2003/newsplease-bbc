It's happened too many times. I've seen a trend now with us, and it will be interesting between now and the end of the season in terms of mentality. We didn't start the game how we wanted.\n\"We talked about being a top team and having talent but also having drive, desire and ambition to win and having spirt, and too many of our players have been too comfortable.\n\"There's no excuse, we also have to give a big, big credit to St Johnstone. We were disappointed in the game in terms of our attitude. Their keeper has made some brilliant saves.\n\"The first-half mentality and attitude is disappointing. It's around comfort; comfortable is not a physical place and if you get comfortable, you don't do the things physically needed.\n\"Whereas St Johnstone, I felt, ran for their lives. They thoroughly deserved the win. It's about your mindset, and that is something that concerns me.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgqv0e89119o"}
