Our laws supersede that of Fifa.\"\n\"We hereby request the National Sports Council [NSC] and security forces to facilitate the smooth take-over of the official activities of the SLFA by the four regional chairmen and the Fifa appointed moral guarantor or his representatives,\" added Tarawally.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40838216"}
