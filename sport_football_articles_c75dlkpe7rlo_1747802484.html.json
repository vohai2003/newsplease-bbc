He was everywhere. He did everything. It was just a complete midfield performance. He passed it well, he tackled, he chased back and he was strong on the ball.\n\"It was always going to be a difficult game, Brentford had won their past five away. They weren't going to come here and lie down.\n\"I thought we were the better side in the first half and to score right on half-time was a big bonus for us but full credit to Brentford - they came out and had a right go in the second half.\n\"I don't think anyone can complain about the penalty, dispatched well. Up to that point, they were the better side and you were starting to get a bit worried at that stage.\n\"But goals change games and that's exactly what Tonali's strike did.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c75dlkpe7rlo"}
