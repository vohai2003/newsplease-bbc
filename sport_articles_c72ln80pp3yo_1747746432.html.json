Never forget, pre-season is about building endurance and strength to get through what lies ahead.\nNo-one wants to lose, but results are a secondary concern.\nThat said, there was not much to get enthused about against Borussia Dortmund - other than the two goals. There were far too many mistakes and no-one really stood out.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c72ln80pp3yo"}
