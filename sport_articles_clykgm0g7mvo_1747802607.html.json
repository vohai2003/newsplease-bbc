So it's the old cliche of taking it one game at a time, but it literally is that.\n\"It's something we spoke about in the autumn. We have to attack every single week like it's a cup final, because we know how hard the Six Nations is to get it right.\n\"If you get one performance wrong, then it's out of your control. So for us first up, Italy, we've got to get that right and then you move on.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/clykgm0g7mvo"}
