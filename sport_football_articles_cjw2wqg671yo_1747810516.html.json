We're a young team and to experience that is historical for them and it was a great day.\n\"But it was a difficult performance, a difficult situation, but I'm very proud of the players.\"\nVance was also impressed with the large crowd - their biggest of the season - who came to see their new home.\n\"It's a historic day and this is the first time Guernsey's had a home of football and you can imagine Murattis here here are going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\"Everyone can aspire to play at this level on this facility and I think the biggest thing for me is an additional 1,500 people saw what we have to deal.\n\"That's a team who are mid-table, they're not ripping up trees, they're not in the mix and we've taken four points off them this season.\n\"But I think people can see that they're physical, they're massive, they manipulate the referees - you saw that with that ridiculous penalty that they tried to get, and that happens.\n\"Sometimes you have to deal with it, and it's a really tough situation to be in and I thought the players stood up to it really well.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjw2wqg671yo"}
