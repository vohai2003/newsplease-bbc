But they're leaky defensively and are likely to play a high line. Arsenal will need a sizeable lead to take to Madrid, and will need to defend solidly at the Bernabeu.\nDerek: With Arsenal anything could happen, but not with the way they have played this season.\nKen: Really, Opta?! You're giving a team which hasn't won anything for quite some time a greater chance than a serial winning machine in Real Madrid? Arsenal have no pedigree of winning the biggest trophy in their history, and have a recent track record of choking in crucial matches at the business end, both in the league and in the League Cup semi final. Arsenal have a chance but I'll believe it when I see it.\nLaura: Yes, the prediction is right. Arsenal will make it to the semi-final of the Champions League.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2ewrgzgn7ro"}
