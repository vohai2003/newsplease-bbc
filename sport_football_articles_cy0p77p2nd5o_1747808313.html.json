He's still learning, still developing physically, still learning how to deal with certain situations on and off the pitch.\n\"These new signings, when they're brought into the club and they're young, I think you have to take the pressure off them a little bit. Don't expect them just to hit the ground running and he's now finding his feet.\n\"It is Premier League football in a team that has been struggling but he is consistently now putting game after game together and becoming one of the first names on the team sheet.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy0p77p2nd5o"}
