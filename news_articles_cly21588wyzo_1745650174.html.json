It's absolutely amazing,\" Hannah said.\nBass player Emer McLaughlin was equally thrilled at the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"I'm so incredibly excited and honoured to be supporting giants Snow Patrol in the SSE Arena.\n\"This has been a literal dream come true for us as an upcoming band in so many ways.\n\"It's such a landmark venue - it's our first ever arena show - and to be supporting a fellow Irish band like Snow Patrol just makes it such an unbelievable experience.\"\nThe members of CHERYM say that when it comes to the music industry they, like many other young bands, need as much exposure as possible in order to progress in a very competitive industry.\n\"This is probably the biggest level of exposure we've ever had,\" says Alannagh.\nAlthough CHERYM are signed to a small independent record label called Alcopop Records, who they say are so artist-friendly, Alannagh says it is \"extremely difficult\" to make a name for yourself.\n\"I saw an article by Sam Fender where he was speaking about the music industry very recently and how ninety per cent of it are people who come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds.\n\"Whereas for a working-class band it is very, very difficult to do that.\"\nAlannagh explained that CHERYM's members rely on funding and other support \"to actually be able to pay our petrol money on the way home and to be able to make a living out of this\".\n\"Some of us have full time jobs in order to make this work,\" she said.\n\"So we have to have a second job in order to pursue our actual passion.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly21588wyzo"}
