I am not sure, and I don't think this game will tell us much either because they should blow Leicester away even if they are nowhere near their best.\nLeicester have not scored a league goal since the end of January, and I don't see that changing at Etihad Stadium. They are at the stage where their fans cheer a corner, let alone a shot at goal - that's desperate, and that's where Leicester are at.\nFrom what Pep was saying, he knows how important this game is for their run-in, as Manchester City look to secure Champions League football next season. I don't think there is any chance they will slip up.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0kxjv0dj6yo"}
