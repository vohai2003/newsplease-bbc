The first coming when he lifted a shot over Mathew Hudson from Tyler Frost's knockdown and then dinking another effort past the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area in added time.\nSix minutes into the second half he completed his hat-trick when he converted Theo Widdrington's square pass.\nOldham had a chance to pull a goal back midway through the half but Shots goalkeeper Marcus Dewhurst saved Billy Waters' penalty as the hosts missed the chance to consolidate their position in the top five.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c70q47we5rlt"}
