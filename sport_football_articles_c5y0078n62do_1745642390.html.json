Looking at the teams in that competition, it does not feel a particularly strong competition, so if they can find a bit of form then they are in with a chance of at least reaching the final.\nA trophy would by no means cover up the issues that they have had but it gives them an opportunity to celebrate a positive.\nMy biggest concern would be them being hit by any more injuries because that could have implications for their Europa League campaign.\nAthough Postecoglou will be driving his players right to the end, it is never good mentally for fans, players and the wider club if there is nothing to play for.\nPlus there have been so many critiques of the manager this season and of the club as a whole, which I am sure the Spurs fans are tired of themselves. The only way to get rid of that is to win games of football.\nPostecoglou was being criticised when the team were doing well, so when they are not, it is obviously heightened. Plus, he has been picking a team for parts of this season that he would not normally have chosen, so it has been difficult to achieve his objectives.\nThat is why I worry about the possibility of any more senior players being lost.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c5y0078n62do"}
