I can't see that happening.\n\"I'm not sure how it's going to work out.\"\nFormer Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare believes regardless of whether he arrives as a starter or not, Raya will improve a squad that fell away after leading the Premier League for the majority of last season.\n\"I also think from a manager's point of view - from what happened last season - he's very keen on strengthening the squad and having the depth to be able to do that,\" he added.\n\"He will definitely improve the squad, in the same way Declan Rice has.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ce5rj2xnegyo"}
