Then everything feels so much better.\nTraining becomes more enjoyable and it is easier to be motivated for other games. Plus, you have more belief in your game plan, your manager and everything that is going on around you.\nSometimes having a strong work rate and a game plan that marries with the ability of the team is better than having a team full of strong individuals.\nNo-one would have thought that Forest, who were fighting relegation last season, would be joint second in the Premier League.\nThey are comfortable in the way they are playing and, although Brighton and Bournemouth have a different style, they are all successful.\nEverything around those clubs is positive, internally and externally at the moment.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgeddjld4lo"}
