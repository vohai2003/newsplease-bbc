McClintock grabbed his second to draw the sides level before substitute Tiernan Brolly netted a late winner.\nFor the record 23-time winners of the competition it ends a drought of over a decade since their last North West Cup success in 2012.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg45v1vd09yo"}
