And in one hour we send you a second boat, OK?\nTell captain to big red ship \"We don't want to go Greece\". OK?\nThe replies of the man captaining the migrant boat are not heard.\nIn a second call, 90 minutes later, at 22:10, a seemingly different officer from the same coordination centre, speaks to the captain of the Lucky Sailor (the \"big red ship\").\nOfficer 2: OK, captain, sorry before I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don't want anything else?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone \"Greece or Italia?\" and everybody there screaming Italia.\nOfficer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don't want Greece and they want Italy?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes.\nOfficer 2: OK\nLucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck.\nOfficer 2: OK, captain. So you have finished with the supplies?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes, sir, yes.\nOfficer 2: Captain, I want this, I want this to write it in your logbook. The bridge logbook.\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes OK, we will write it.\nOfficer 2: OK?\nLucky Sailor captain: Yes\nOfficer 2: I want you to write it about that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy. They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy.\nLucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes.\nAnother vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged.\nThe Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted \"all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events\" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating.\nIt said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17qe11wy52o"}
