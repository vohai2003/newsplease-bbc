He, too, said he would appeal against the decision.\nBorn To Succeed, a five-year-old gelding, was banned from running in any race for 40 days.\nMaguire's mount finished 23 and three-quarter lengths behind the winner, 20-1 shot King Alfonso.\nThe British Horseracing Authority said in a statement: \"The rider stated that his instructions were to drop the gelding in and get him settled and then to do his best work late on.\n\"He further added that the gelding became very tired at the entrance to the home straight, was not quick enough to take any gaps and did not jump well in the closing stages. He therefore felt it prudent to keep a good hold of the horse.\n\"The trainer confirmed that the rider had ridden in accordance with his instructions and added that Born To Succeed is an extremely nervous horse at home.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/31527343"}
