Seven of those came for the late jockey Campbell Gillies, whose mother Lesley is one of the owners.\nBalder Succes won the Ascot Chase, in which Ptit Zig was a faller, while Champagne Fever scored in Ireland.\nThe Willie Mullins-trained Champagne Fever ran out a comfortable winner of the Red Mills Chase at Gowran Park.\nHe is now as short as 4-1 for the the Queen Mother Champion Chase at next month's Cheltenham Festival, where previous champions Sprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy are potential opponents.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/31469993"}
