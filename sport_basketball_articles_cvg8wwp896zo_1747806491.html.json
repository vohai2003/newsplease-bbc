It also brings the knowhow, connections and vision to excite those who already love the game and to attract new fans and participants.\n\"To have booming professional leagues which enable our top players to compete in front of British fans, week in and week out, is just what we need in order to fulfil British basketball's huge potential.\"\nGBBL managing director and CEO Marshall Glickman said: \"We are fully committed to uplifting the popularity of basketball in Great Britain.\n\"We are especially focused on making our league attractive to homegrown players, both in terms of economics and development. We want to see our players lead the GB national team to the 2028 LA Olympics.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/articles/cvg8wwp896zo"}
