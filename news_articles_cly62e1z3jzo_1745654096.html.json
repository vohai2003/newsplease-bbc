You never think it's going to happen to you but it shouldn't be left,\" says Christine.\n\"People think it's an age thing but it's something you can do as soon as you are married.\"\nNorman currently has some mobility and speech issues, but it is hoped he will be able to get out of hospital and continue rehabilitation at home.\nOn the day we visited, the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley was full.\nThere was no room on the stroke ward where Norman was being cared for to admit a further four patients who needed to be in the ward.\nOne of those patients was still in the Emergency Department, which was operating at double its usual capacity.\nDuring winter it was routinely four times its capacity.\nDr Chris McDonald, the clinical director for emergency medicine at the RAH and at Inverclyde hospital, says this winter is the worst he has seen.\nHis department has routinely been operating at 400% capacity.\n\"It's been incredibly difficult, I think we have all felt the strain,\" he said.\n\"We are walking down corridors that are completely full of patients and people are asking us for help and you've not got no time.\"\nHe says the single biggest challenge they face is getting patients onto the wards for further care.\nProf Wallace says: \"Every single day we could do better in terms of getting people both in and out of hospital.\n\"Across our sites, I think we are close to 100% occupancy. We don't want to care for patients in areas they shouldn't be cared for, it's not ideal.\"\nThe Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) is calling on the Scottish government to introduce legislative reform around power of attorney and guardianship provisions, with funding attached to make it easier for people to put in place.\nDr Conor Maguire, vice president (international) at RCPE, says it can lead to elderly patients or those with dementia spending up to half their remaining lives in a hospital bed which is unsuitable and disruptive.\n\"The government should move forward with modifying the law around guardianship provisions so that patients who lack capacity to make decisions about their care can be moved from an NHS healthcare environment to an appropriate social care environment without delay â€“ ideally to the nursing or care home in which they are to reside indefinitely - while they wait for the outcome of the court process,\" he said.\nThe Scottish government it had published analysis last month of responses to a consultation on proposals for reform of the Adults with Incapacity Act, including powers of attorney and guardianship orders.\nA spokesperson said: \"We are now considering those responses and working towards modernising the AWI Act, taking forward recommendations from the Scottish Mental Health Law Review.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly62e1z3jzo"}
