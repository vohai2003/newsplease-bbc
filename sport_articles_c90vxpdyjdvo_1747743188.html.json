I expect a [Celtic] team who will press us, try to score goals, and will want a lot of the ball. There won't be too much of a difference [to last season], but there will be slight tweaks I would imagine.\n\"He's probably not got the full squad he would like, but they'll try to keep the ball, and that's what we have to try to combat.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c90vxpdyjdvo"}
