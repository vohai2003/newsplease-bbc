Those who know me and appreciate those values understand what I say,\" he said.\n\"The bottom line is that sometimes the little things I do on the pitch provoke exaggerated reactions.\"\nCosta, who joined Chelsea from Atletico Madrid for Â£32m in July 2014, says he has received some rough treatment by players from other teams which should have been more harshly dealt with.\n\"Some of the kicks I suffer in England would be punished with a red card in Spain,\" he added.\n\"I am getting used to getting kicked more than before. Premier League defenders are really strong and physical.\n\"In England, the referees don't call many fouls, as opposed to Spanish football. Consequently, you must be really strong all through the 90 minutes.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/31450221"}
