We believe the goal should have stood. Willie will no doubt speak about it himself, maybe in the early part of next week, and give his own feelings on it.\n\"To disallow a goal the way it was disallowed on Wednesday night with no real conclusive evidence is not within the rules - it is as simple as that.\"\nGoodwin says he is still \"a big advocate\" for VAR but that his issue is with the way the technology is being used.\nHe suggested perhaps the way to avoid high-profile incidents like the one involving Dalby is for the Scottish game to dig deep to pay for \"the top VAR package that is available\".\n\"I am led to believe that each club in the Premiership is paying in excess of Â£100,000 a year for the equipment,\" he explained.\n\"Now, I don't think that we are paying for the top VAR package that is available and it is just whether clubs are willing to pay that little bit more to make sure that we get even more camera angles.\n\"If we had the different camera angles that they have got in the English Premier League then you would be able to see 100% whether that ball was in or out [in the recent Hibernian-Celtic game]. The same with the Sam Dalby one - had we had a better VAR system in place then there might have been better camera angles to show whether there was a hand ball or not.\n\"It is all about money at the end of the day, it comes down to the investment. I am not one, at this moment in time, for throwing VAR in the bin. I don't think that is the way forward, I just think we have got to get better at using the technology.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c39vjk8zl8lo"}
