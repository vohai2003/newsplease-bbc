Hugely talented but utterly uncontrollable would seem the best description.\nHe now faces a lengthy ban, has let his team down by costing them a chance to win the tie and will miss a crucial period of the season. And for what?\nA few weeks back, he ripped the glasses off a steward - not that big and brave.\nThis time he threw a one-two combination with his fists that wouldn't have hurt a five-year-old, before delivering a sneaky little kick that his opponent would scarcely have felt but every camera picked up.\nHe then produced a headbutt with all the force of a kiss from your auntie, before causing a scene in the tunnel that was at the intellectual level of a toddler.\nAll a bit pathetic, if you ask me.\nWith brilliant goals - like the one he scored before his hissy fit - and world-class skills, he should be worth fortunes, but he is now considered damaged goods.\nHis opponents, on the other hand, are laughing at his antics and the ease in which they wind him up.\nIt is time to grow up, Matheus.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cn52k724574o"}
