I don't know where that came from. We had such strong performances heading into the game.\n\"When you concede goals as cheaply as we did today, it drains confidence. Hearts caught us on a bad day and they had a good day. These things happen.\n\"For all the credit we got for recent performances, we now deserve a lot of criticism and I deserve a lot of criticism because I lead the group. I apologise to the Dundee fans. The players will be in tomorrow morning to address that.\n\"It is a new group, a very young team. It can happen. It is important to learn from that. It is my job to improve on that performance. The fans should not see that type of performance.\n\"I did not see that type of performance coming. You could see the confidence draining as the game went on. I was a bit surprised.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0lzxn14ey1o"}
