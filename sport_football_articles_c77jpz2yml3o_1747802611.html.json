I'm so proud of the way we played. We had some chances to get a two-goal margin but we weren't able to take them.\n\"It's frustrating. Look, we look on this game and the last game with a lot of pride in what we are doing and we will keep on going.\n\"We had to defend a lot and I thought we managed the second half well. The players are right in it together and are approaching the games in the right manner.\n\"I don't know where we are exactly in the table. We are just focusing on ourselves.\n\"We've got a little pause for the FA Cup and then we look forward to Brighton and Manchester City.\"\nOn signing Ben Godfrey on loan: \"We wanted to add to that area. Ben is a good player and an experienced player.\n\"That will be a good boost for us in the second half of this season.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77jpz2yml3o"}
