Apart from Connor Randall's closing down and ball winning, our midfield was non existent. So heads up and onwards with the main task at hand, to stay in the league.\nJohn: Hugely disappointed in the football. A golden chance blown away by long-ball tactics against a taller defence. No thought of playing out from the back. Old school football.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cr5dn52p8rno"}
