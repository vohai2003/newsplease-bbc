Today it was there,\" said Nuno.\n\"We were compact and didn't allow Arsenal too much. Arsenal had chances, of course, because they are a very good team. But at the same time, we were compact, solid and aggressive.\n\"Maybe we could have found better transition points but it is always difficult. The positive is the clean sheet and, more than anything, finding ourselves as a team again with the way we do things.\n\"In the last moments of the game, we were the team getting the set-pieces and the dangerous momentum. That is a positive, also.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cj3nn5yr5ldo"}
