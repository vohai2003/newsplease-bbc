In the first half an hour we were playing good football from the back, finding solutions. They are probably one of the best teams in terms of transition, we conceded some.\n\"The result is important of course but it was important to see the intention of the players, how they received ideas. To be honest they were good.\n\"We created chances against this team. Sometimes you spend 95 minutes without creating a chance. The first half an hour we found solutions, space and created chances. Then we conceded a goal. When you concede transition against this kind of team, it's always dangerous.\"\nLeicester take on Coventry in their Championship opener on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cye55lgyd96o"}
