It has been long for the players to understand that when you don't have the ball, you can still win games.\n\"Everyone thinks that having the ball makes you a winner, which is not always the case.\"\nShe added: \"It's starting to look like I want it to look like.\n\"Defensively, it's not good enough yet. We've taken too many goals in the second phase, and we have to improve that. But on the offensive aspects, I think the last games' first half looks closer to what they'd like to have.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c17q42ngk8go"}
