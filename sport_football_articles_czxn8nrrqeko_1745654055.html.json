Champions? Ask me again in a month. I wouldn't be so bold.\nChris: Why can't we just play the last 20 mins all the time?\nSeljuk: The rabbit jumps out of the hat again! Brilliant stuff.\nBut it's clear that - assuming promotion - we must sign an experienced, reliable goalkeeper if we're to have any chance of surviving the PL.\nAnd a few more battle-hardened PL players for the team's spine.\nJesse Marsch made the mistake of signing all players abroad when he got his first full season at Leeds. The answer is at home.\nRich: It's the team unity, that's impressed me the last 2 weeks.\nThere's a belief amongst the players. They believe no matter what the game situation they can get a result.\nFarke had also showed so great tactical changes in the last few games.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/czxn8nrrqeko"}
