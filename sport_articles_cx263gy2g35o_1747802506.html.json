Leighton Clarkson was brought on at the interval and formed an attacking duo with Duk that fashioned a couple of decent opportunities, with the former Liverpool midfielder smacking a shot off the bar.\nStill fourth, for now, they'll just be hoping they're due a win by the law of averages at this rate, as they seem unable to conjure one up by their own doing.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx263gy2g35o"}
