That's why he's one of the best wingers in the world because he attacks the box and sniffs the goal.\n\"You take them, he's in the right position at the right time and topped off a great night for him and for us.\n\"He gives us an outlet. All of our front players are so different and rotate so well. [Gabriel] Martinelli - unbelievable tonight, real outlet for us and done well for Bukayo's goal. With Bukayo back it's a real boost.\"\nOn the overall game: \"Tough. Most teams play back fives here now and it's down to us to break that down. Tough when they come to the edge of the box. You have to be mindful. It was comfortable but probably the last 10-15 minutes we were a bit naive and they could've scored two or three.\"\nOn Gabriel injury: \"I don't know what's happened, I hope he's OK because he's been arguably our best player this season and we need him for big matches and big occasions.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjl4qndj8eo"}
