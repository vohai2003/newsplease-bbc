They actually finished the game with fewer attempts on goal than Leicester but took their chances, with the help of some poor defending.\nThe back-to-back wins - their first in almost a year - means the rest of the season is effectively a write off, but that gives Potter an extended period to start putting him imprint on the team for next season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1mnn7kjerno"}
