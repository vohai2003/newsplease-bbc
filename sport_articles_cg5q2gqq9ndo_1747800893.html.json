The difference was in both boxes, they were ruthless in attack and defence. They got a chance and they score it, we got one at the death and we didn't.\n\"We need to be a bit more ruthless in the game on Tuesday.\n\"Right until the end we were at least chasing a goal, we don't accept 4-0. I love the passion and the work rate the girls have, we need to bring that as a minimum to match teams like this.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg5q2gqq9ndo"}
