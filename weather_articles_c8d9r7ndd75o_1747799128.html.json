And, every 11 years its polarity changes direction.\nThis is known as a 'flip' - marking the point at which the Sun is halfway through its activity peak or 'solar maximum'. During this time there is an increase in the number of eruptions from the Sun, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\nThese eruptions send powerful bursts of energy and material into space which can disrupt radio communications and GPS signals, as well as cause geomagnetic storms.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c8d9r7ndd75o"}
