It was the same spot where he gave the now famous \"we are all here\" speech with his cabinet on the second day of Russia's invasion.\nBack then, he'd turned down offers to leave. Many in the West expected Russia to be in the capital within days, with the president being captured or killed.\nThree years on, it seems his choice to keep fighting has gradually been taken away from him.\nHe said he was ready to work under Trump's \"strong leadership\" and that it was \"time to make things right\".\nWashington's hostile rhetoric, that Oval Office meeting and the \"pausing\" of US military aid have forced him to bend to Trump's peace vision.\nUp until last week, Zelensky had held firm that Ukraine would only agree to peace if its security was guaranteed, otherwise it would fight on.\nHe also accused Trump of living in a \"disinformation space\" after the US president repeated some of Moscow's claims.\nAll of this served as a prelude to Friday's fiery exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, who accused Zelensky of having \"disrespected\" the US and ultimately told him to leave.\nThe Ukrainian leader had a warmer reception from European leaders at the weekend - but while they pledged to help secure Ukraine in the future, they made clear peace would still require US involvement.\nThen, on Tuesday, Trump paused US military aid to Ukraine, raising concerns it may only be able to hold out for a matter of months - and leaving Zelensky to make his peace with the situation.\nIn a letter to the US president, he even gave specifics on what the first stage of a peace process could involve, including a naval and aerial ceasefire - proposals first suggested by France's President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend.\nTrump said he appreciated the letter, in a sign of cooling tensions between the two leaders, and that Zelensky had agreed to strike a peace deal.\nWhat is more telling is Zelensky's willingness now to sign a mineral deal without the security guarantees he is hoping for - and had portrayed as essential until very recently.\nThe US has suggested the presence of US companies mining for natural resources would be enough to put Russia off breaking a ceasefire. However, American businesses didn't exactly put Moscow off from launching its full-scale invasion.\nWhat's even more telling are the lack of compromises Russia would seemingly have to make in any peace agreement.\nPerhaps Zelensky has run out of political road, and with his European allies acknowledging that they still need the US, Washington seems still to be the only place for him to turn to.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gde1zj5pyo"}
