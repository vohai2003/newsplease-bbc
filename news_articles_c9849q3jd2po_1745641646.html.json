Dates were eaten and prayers said before the meal was served.\n\"It's very kind of the Royal Family to open their home to us,\" one woman told the BBC.\nAnother added: \"We never thought we'd be here breaking Iftar. We've come a long way.\"\nFor those who ate in His Majesty's Windsor home, it was a memory of a lifetime.\n\"I studied history at university, so to actually open my fast in Windsor Castle is not something I ever thought I would do,\" another woman said.\n\"To mix my Muslim identity with that historical knowledge is a real privilege.\"\nAnother attendee said: \"I've never been to Windsor Castle before, so this is an awesome experience. The first time to be here and to do it in a Islamic way - amazing.\"\nAnother invited the King to join them for dinner during the religious month.\n\"Any day, any time,\" they said. \"We've got Ramadan for 30 days. Let me know when you're ready.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9849q3jd2po"}
