I'd go so far as saying I'd be buying a white flag of surrender for Mr Fields to wave whenever he sees me when I drop my daughter off at school.\nThese two sides drew 1-1 earlier in the season, when a 95th-minute Sam Morsy goal denied Saints the win.\nI don't think Ipswich will keep a clean sheet this time, either, but I am backing Liam Delap to come good, and help them pick up what would be a huge three points.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg0mj7kl3eo"}
