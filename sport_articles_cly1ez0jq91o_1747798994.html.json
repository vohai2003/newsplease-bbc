That's back-to-back clean sheets for us.\n\"Disappointed with how we managed the game, especially in the second half.\n\"I don't think we managed it well enough, but at the same time, I can't be too critical of the players. At this stage of the season, it's about getting results.\n\"It's such a tough place to come with everything Hearts are still playing for. I've managed to do my old club St Mirren a slight turn as well today.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cly1ez0jq91o"}
