They scored two goals with two shots on target, that was the worst part as we controlled the game.\n\"We had chances one minute before the 1-0 when the defender [Dara O'Shea] cleared off the line and those are the small margins when you are in a bad moment and everything is against you.\n\"It's a bad result for us, but we need to stay together and focus on the things we can improve. We had all the ball in the opposition half, but when they [Ipswich] arrived [in the penalty area] they punished us. We had chances to score more and it is costing us a lot.\n\"We finished very strongly and physically we were in a good place. Our offensive players were not in the form they have been for most of the season and we have to keep believing in them. We need to improve defensively and not make any mistakes or concede chances so we don't have to get three or four goals to win a game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgkg1dm72keo"}
