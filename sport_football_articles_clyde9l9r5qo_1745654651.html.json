The same goes for the visitors, whose priorities surely lie with increasing the gap between themselves and the bottom three.\nBut make no mistake, Bournemouth are still in a position for which most fans would have bitten off their own hands, let alone anyone else's, to be in after 27 league games.\nJustin Kluivert, in netting another contender for his personal goal of the season competition on Tuesday, also broke new ground in becoming the first Cherries player to score 10 away goals in a Premier League season.\nHe told BBC Radio Solent that Bournemouth \"played a good game, especially in the second half where we created a lot of chances, but we've got to be more dangerous in those areas\".\nAnother view was given by former Tottenham and Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Reid on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"This is just a little blip for Bournemouth,\" the ex-Republic of Ireland international said.\n\"They are a good side and will bounce back. They went on an incredible run before these recent games, [so] were bound to hit a bump.\"\nWill Reid be proved right - can Iraola's men reset their upward course? It should be an interesting watch, either way.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/clyde9l9r5qo"}
