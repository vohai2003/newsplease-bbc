Football is simple. We need to win these matches and even more, we need to concentrate on our performance, try to play our way.\n\"We need to try to compete, be hard to beat. All these things, we did today. That gives us the possibility to win.\n\"If you come here and try and play a basketball game with this team, you're not going to win. We did very well with the ball first-half.\n\"We didn't create but we took the momentum out. We knew it would open up second-half. Stay solid, defend, and we will get the chance.\n\"I'm not looking at who is in front of us. Next week is a Cup week so we put the league situation aside for one week. We have made this mistake before but we need to focus on our own job.\n\"Our fans are following us, giving us the noise, pushing the team. Yes, it was a close even game but we played a very good away match and we deserve it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5yv25pvz1vo"}
