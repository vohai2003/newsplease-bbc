It will cost anyone who wants Alexander Isak an awful lot of money to sign him.\nIt would make Arsenal, or indeed anyone else, a more realistic contender for trophies if they had Isak in their side, although I do not see any way this is happening in January with Newcastle so close to the EFL Cup final and right in the hunt for the top four.\nWould it make Newcastle look like a small club? I wouldn't go that far because lots of clubs end up selling their best players, even the so-called big ones. Of course, Newcastle have to also make judgements on profit and sustainability rules, so my answer to the second part of the question would be \"no\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn8yllv5pxqo"}
