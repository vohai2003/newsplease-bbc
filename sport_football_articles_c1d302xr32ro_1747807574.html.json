The match was a gritty and tetchy affair - typical of a Black Country derby - but the highlight came courtesy of our number 10.\nWolves were already in the lead, thanks to a phenomenal strike by Pedro Neto, and then came Cunha's moment of magic.\nDoubling the advantage with a clinical finish, he ran directly to the away end, his celebration was pure and unapologetic. The Wolves end erupted in unrestrained joy, with a wave of relief washing over fans who knew Monday morning would be free of any ridicule.\nIn that electric moment, Cunha showed that he truly understood what it meant to wear the shirt.\nFist pumping, badge pointing and arms gesturing to the away fans, Cunha bellowed: \"We own this place!\" It wasn't just his words - it was the passion and the raw emotion.\nThe cherry on top? His 'ownership' was briefly immortalised on Wikipedia, where he was humorously listed as the owner of West Bromwich Albion and The Hawthorns. Classic football banter at its finest.\nWhat made it even more special was the history. Wolves hadn't won at The Hawthorns since September 1996 - a staggering 28 years.\nThat streak had weighed heavily on this fixture, piling pressure on players and fans alike, but Cunha helped end that painful chapter, delivering what felt like sweet redemption for every Wolves fan in attendance.\nUnfortunately, such joyous moments have been scarce since. Yet, hope remains.\nWith VÃ­tor Pereira now at the helm, there is a belief that Wolves can make the necessary changes to rebuild and secure our place in the Premier League.\nLet's hope the best is yet to come.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1d302xr32ro"}
