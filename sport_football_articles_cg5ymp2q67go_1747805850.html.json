She should be one of the candidates, absolutely.\n\"All teams need their goalscorer. Last season it was Martha Thomas. This season it's been Bethany. You need one of them to be consistent. The best thing about England is how she is as a person and a leader. She's a great role model for the younger ones to represent the club.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg5ymp2q67go"}
