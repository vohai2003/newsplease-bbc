We've done more than enough to take something from the game.\n\"It's something we need to learn from. Three goals should be enough to win a game. We've had more than enough opportunities. There's so much more we can do to prevent those Rangers goals.\n\"It was two teams trying to win the game, maybe that shows a bit of naivety [from us] on the pitch.\n\"It's a straight ball and Cyriel Dessers gets in. Hugely disappointing to lose a game in that manner. But I've got to reflect on my team's performance in a positive sense.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5y4yn4z6qlo"}
