I wouldn't say I'm the loudest so it doesn't come naturally to me, but it's something she wants me to improve on.\n\"She encourages the more experienced players to coach a bit and puts more onus on us on the pitch. If we feel things that she can't, then she is more than happy for us to help and find solutions.\n\"It's nice to be pushed that way and for older players to have that responsibility. She's always pretty open to people making their own decisions and choices.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66321244"}
