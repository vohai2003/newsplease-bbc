They came eighth in the table and that meant they got automatic qualification, which as one of the lower seeded teams is an incredible achievement.\n\"They have looked like they belong and that is the most you can say for a team that hasn't been in the competition for 40 years.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvgwnmn2k2ro"}
