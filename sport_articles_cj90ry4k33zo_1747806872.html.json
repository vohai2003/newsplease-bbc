However, only one of those six has come in his seven away games against the Saints (D2 L4), winning 1-0 in August 2022 with Aberdeen.\nDundee United have scored at least once in nine of their last 10 away league games, only failing at Aberdeen in October (1-0 defeat).\nSt Johnstone have lost 11 and won just two of their 17 home league games in 2024 (D4). It's the most home defeats by a side in a single calendar year in the Scottish Premiership since 2018, when Hamilton lost 13 and Dundee lost 12.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cj90ry4k33zo"}
