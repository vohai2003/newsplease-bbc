They are responsible for most of our rain and strong winds.\nThe systems are driven by winds 10km (6miles) up in the atmosphere, known as the jet stream which is like a river of faster flowing air.\nAs the jet speeds up or slows down, our high and low pressures form at the surface and these shape the changes in our day-to-day weather.\nHowever, from time to time the jet stream can be disrupted by a 'blocked weather pattern', which is what we are experiencing now.\nIf we get stuck under high pressure in the summer you can get hot and dry spells, like the summer of 1976 where temperatures stayed in the 30Cs and there was no rain for weeks on end.\nIt is important to remember that high pressure usually means dry weather, but not always sunny weather.\nIn the winter when cloud gets trapped under an area of high pressure - known as 'anticyclonic gloom' - we end up with unrelenting dull days.\nIt is also important to remember that low pressure means wet weather. If the pattern of the block leads to low pressure being stuck over the UK, this can lead to lots of rain and flooding.\nThere are two set-ups which disrupt the usual eastwards run of weather systems, called the 'Omega' and the 'Diffluent' blocks.\nBoth happen when the jet stream weakens. The river of air slows down and then starts to meander northwards and southwards, forming ridges or troughs.\nThe Omega block is named for its resemblance to the Greek letter, Omega, which results in a persistent high pressure with low pressure either side.\nIt has been so dry for the last few weeks in March because high pressure has been stationary near the UK. The rain has to fall somewhere though and this blocking pattern has left low pressure stuck over Iberia, which is why it has been so wet in Spain and Portugal recently.\nAn Omega block is believed to have been a contributing factor to the devastating flooding in Valencia in autumn 2024.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cly507egz2zo"}
