But, after a stand of 121 with Clark, he then mistimed an attempted pull off Ali, to hole out at backward square on the off side and give the teenage leg-spinner his maiden first-class wicket.\nBut, on what looked a very good batting surface, and with a shortish boundary on the north side and a lightning fast outfield, Sussex then took control.\nFrom 232-4 at tea, Clark and Simpson added a further 129 in the evening session.\nWith the natural light fading and the Edgbaston floodlights on, Ed Barnard finally got some reward for his pace and persistence late on when, after troubling Clark with a short-pitched delivery that reared up at him, he did get his man, caught behind by another of the Bears' new boys Smith.\nBut Simpson carried on plundering runs in the company of Jack Carson to reach the 16th century of his first-class career - and his sixth for Sussex.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cj3n4ylzrdlo"}
