Venkatesh Iyer struck 60 from 29 balls with seven fours and three sixes, while Rinku Singh made an unbeaten 32 from 17.\nThey capitalised on a platform set by skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Angkrish Raghuvanshi, who added a third-wicket stand of 81 following the early departures of openers Quinton de Kock and Sunil Narine.\nSunrisers started their IPL campaign by posting 286, the tournament's second-highest total of all time, but have since lost three matches in a row.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c2del6k10d3o"}
