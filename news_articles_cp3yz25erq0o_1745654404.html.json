From 16:00 GMT to 18:00 in Bridgwater you cannot move,\" she said.\nMs Cummins added she does her shopping out of town because she cannot park in the centre.\nGraham Hodgson, the owner of The Cobblestones pub and music venue, said when the roadworks were directly outside his business between August and November footfall dropped.\nHe said takings were down by 30% to 50% and he was \"at the point of making redundancies\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3yz25erq0o"}
