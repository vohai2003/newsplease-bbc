It could be others as well,\" he added.\nA day earlier on Fox News, Lutnick had raised the possibility of a compromise and reduction of tariffs for Mexico and Canada, saying Trump was weighing offers to meet his allies \"in the middle\".\nTrump has said he would move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yx02nnnyvo"}
