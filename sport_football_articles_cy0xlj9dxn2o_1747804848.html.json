Very good. Just a lot of good decisions from Sandro and I think that's what makes him the player that he is.\n\"I think you're always getting 'well done' and they're not necessarily outstanding moments but when you add them together, it just turns into a very forceable performance from midfield.\n\"He's very good athletically and he helped a number of times in putting out fires on transitions. It was a very good individual performance.\"\nOn Tonali's comments that his goal was \"70% a cross\", Howe told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"You'll have to talk me through the percentages - 70 per cent, 30 per cent. I don't really understand that. Maybe he can talk me through it.\n\"I think he, as we all know, he has got an unbelievable strike on him when he hits the ball and connects and he did in that moment. We were just delighted to see it go in.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy0xlj9dxn2o"}
