We were lucky to go in level at half-time and unlucky to lose so late. Well done and congratulations to Arsenal.\nChris: Disappointed to lose but we didn't do too badly last season after losing the Community Shield. Feel we are missing another attacking threat but hopefully we get a winger before the transfer window closes.\nPat: Overall I'm really pleased with the performance, far the better team and Arsenal only managed to score through a massive deflection in the 101st minute. We are always slow starters but today has given me greater confidence than ever. Great to see a solid performance from Kovacic and we also looked so strong at the back, with Gvardiol still to come.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c1e0y48j04do"}
