I donâ€™t see complacency.\nI see a group who believe they can improve on last season, but realise it will not be easy.\nPre-season can sometimes be a bit false as there are periods of high intensity and tough training, with some relaxation. The pressure is off a little bit.\nNo professional athlete likes to lose at any point, but this is a time for positives to be built on and mistakes to be rectified.\nThe mood will be shaped by results, but Mikel Arteta has a group of young, hungry players who want to listen to him.\nThat is a good start.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2qddzl394go"}
