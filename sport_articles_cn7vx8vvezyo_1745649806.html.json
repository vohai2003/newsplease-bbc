I never saw it coming, but there's clearly a problem in terms of playing at home. That's something we need to get to the bottom of.\n\"There was a real lack of energy. Second half, they came back a wee bit but I had to make a few changes to make that happen. Overall, it's not good enough. There's no way I'm going to say otherwise.\n\"I said to the players 'the fans will go with you if you show passion' and I didn't see as much of that as I wanted to.\n\"I'm going to give it everything to try and solve the problem. I'm positive I will fix it.\n\"There are good players, technically. To play at Rangers you need to be mentally strong.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cn7vx8vvezyo"}
