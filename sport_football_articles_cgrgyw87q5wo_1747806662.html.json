They have been on the lash for a long time after winning the Carabao Cup, culminating - for some of their fans anyway - with their trophy parade on Saturday. I am sure the players have sunk a few too.\nIt showed how much the club's success means to the city, but now they have to focus on the rest of the season, because getting back into the Champions League would be massive for what comes next for Eddie Howe's side, and how they are viewed across Europe.\nThere will be a fantastic atmosphere at this game too, but the danger with that is we know Brentford are capable of spoiling anyone's party with their attacking threat.\nHowe has tried to address that by speaking about the need to finish the campaign strongly, and this is a great example of where his side cannot afford to take their eye off the ball.\nI suspect they will come out of the traps very quickly against Brentford, lifted by the crowd, and go a couple of goals up before the weekend starts to take its toll on them and the fans too.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgrgyw87q5wo"}
