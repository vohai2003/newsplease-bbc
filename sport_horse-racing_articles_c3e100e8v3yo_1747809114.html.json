But, although he failed to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, he dropped in trip to win the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Festival in 1998 - a race he won again with Azertyuiop (2004) and Politologue (2020).\nIn his latter years, Hales has enjoyed shared joint ownership with legendary ex-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Peter Done and Ged Mason.\nThey paid 740,000 euros (Â£618,577) last year for Caldwell Potter, who is in training with former champion trainer Nicholls.\nNicholls said on X: \"It is with great sadness to report that John Hales passed away last evening.\n\"A great man and a fantastic owner and friend for many people. Thoughts with his wife Pat and his wonderful family. He will be missed by so many in racing. RIP John.\"\nHales was at Windsor to enjoy his last winner just 12 days ago when Harry Skelton rode Protektorat, for brother Dan Skelton, to a 22-length win over Venetia Williams' Djelo in the Fleur De Lys Chase.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/articles/c3e100e8v3yo"}
