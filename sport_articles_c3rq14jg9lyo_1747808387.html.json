Second half we were miles off it.\nWe travel to Celtic on Boxing Day then have Rangers at home on 29 December. I fear those games will either be a cricket score where they annihilate us, or they put out weaker teams because they've got the derby looming, and we can sneak a result.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3rq14jg9lyo"}
