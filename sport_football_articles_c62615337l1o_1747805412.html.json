The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from.\n\"I think the handball is quite clear. In the last two or three days there were many different moments in different games. Without VAR it's complicated.\n\"We tried to come here and make our game. We had a few chances at 2-1. Now we can focus on the Premier League and Conference League.\n\"We always try to win the games. But in the same way you have to take the consequence of the result.\"\nWill this affect Friday's game? \"I don't think so. Different competition, different game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62615337l1o"}
