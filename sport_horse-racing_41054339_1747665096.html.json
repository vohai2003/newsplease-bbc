I have been with him five years now and we've had some great days. It's fantastic for the owners.\"\nBattaash, expected to be Lady Aurelia's main challenger, finished fourth.\nLady Aurelia trainer Wes Ward was proud of his horse in defeat.\n\"She's a true champion, these things happen. She ran a brilliant race and the other filly ran us down,\" he said. \"I think we got beat fair and square. She's run a fantastic race and I'm very proud of her.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/41054339"}
