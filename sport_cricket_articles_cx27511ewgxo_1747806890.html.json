I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 â€“ given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80.\n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cx27511ewgxo"}
