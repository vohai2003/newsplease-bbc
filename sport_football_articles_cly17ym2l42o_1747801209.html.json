It is a tough place to come. They are a team that is very physical and direct. The start of the second half was very poor, we gave the ball away, were very insecure and then the decision with the penalty comes. For me, it is never a penalty.\n\"The game just started in the second half, you want to get some momentum. We never got to that because the game became really different.\"\nOn the physicality shown: \"It's always like this. That's a big strength of the Premier League and you have to deal with that. You have to live with that like many other teams in the Premier League.\"\nOn the positives to take from the game: \"We had some very big chances that we didn't finish very well, apart form the goal. They didn't generate anything at all, so it's very disappointing that we conceded a goal.\"\nOn drawing 11 games this season: \"You have to win many more games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly17ym2l42o"}
