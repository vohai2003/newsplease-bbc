The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.\nScientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.\nA fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.\nExperts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.\nThe process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.\nFor a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgr2n8xx5gyo"}
