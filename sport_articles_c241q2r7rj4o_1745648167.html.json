There's very very good points in that performance but we want to come out with three points.\n\"It's a penalty. It's very clear, the Celtic bench were very clear on it. It's not given, they go up the other end and score. Football is very cruel at times.\n\"The decision changes things but we still go and concede the goal. If you keep it at 3-2 and he doesn't give the penalty, the game is very much still alive.\n\"There's four games to play, 12 points to play for and that can make a huge difference in the standings.\n\"The top six is hard to get into, we've overachieved in the last two seasons, we know what we're missing but financially that's hard to do. to still be in the running it's very much a case of how many points we can pick up in the next four games.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c241q2r7rj4o"}
