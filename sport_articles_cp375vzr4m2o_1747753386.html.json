We didn't control the game like we wanted and we lost more ball than we have to to control the match.\n\"Overall, I'm happy with the result, with different players and practising in different ways tactically. We have to continue being positive.\n\"There are still three days here and we're going to keep working. Working hard and being positive trying to do the next step in our tactical issues better than today and continuing in the way we did on Sunday.\"\nVilla continue their preparations for the new season when they come up against Brentford in Washington DC on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cp375vzr4m2o"}
