It's frustrating because that becomes the narrative. With the chances we had and the situations we got into, you have to put the ball in the net.\n\"We've been here before but I'll see what he's like in training and see how he reacts. It's very naive to think 'the goalie makes a mistake, so change the goalie'.\n\"If the goalie you put in makes a mistake in the next game, where do you go then? Change him again? I don't think so. I will rely on my experience to make the right decisions. But the responsibility of the team is to score some goals in a game we were on top of for most of it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly520r92pxo"}
