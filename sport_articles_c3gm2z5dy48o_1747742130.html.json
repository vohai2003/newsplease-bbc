We were the better team in the first half. It was important that we showed the belief we could still get something from the game and I was really pleased with the response.\n\"We hit the post twice, and we're unlucky not to win. We had 17 shots, and I thought we were the better time. I'm a little disappointed not to win the game.\n\"We were getting into areas. My two strikers, Luke McCowan and Lyall Cameron linked up really well. I thought the crowd were fantastic today, they saw what the players were putting in and they got behind them.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3gm2z5dy48o"}
