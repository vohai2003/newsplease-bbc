I think Liverpool will try to negotiate that fee down and I think they should quite frankly, because £50m for a player with one good season in a relegated team in the Premier League - even by today's standards, I still think that's too much.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cyx9drx0q7zo"}
