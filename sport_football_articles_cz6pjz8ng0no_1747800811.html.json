Harvey Barnes' £38m move to Newcastle and Timothy Castagne's £15m transfer to Fulham in 2023 will be included in their latest accounts, while the £10m compensation banked from former manager Enzo Maresca's switch to Chelsea in the summer will also ease losses.\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall's £30m transfer to Chelsea is also included.\nThe £92.5m loss from 2022 will now drop off the three-year assessment period but the £90m loss from 2023 remains, while the Foxes' accounts from 2023-24 - their season in the Championship - are yet to be made public.\nRelegation back to the Championship - which they remain in danger of - would have a damaging impact on the club's finances again. In 2024, after their initial charge, Leicester accused the English Football League of \"conspiring with the Premier League to use unlawful means and to procure or induce a breach of contract by the Premier League\" as relationships deteriorated.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz6pjz8ng0no"}
