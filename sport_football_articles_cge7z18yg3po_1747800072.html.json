We were down in the dumps after last week. It wasn't us, it wasn't like us, but today was definitely us.\n\"It is all credit to the team. This lad [Anthony Elanga] puts it on a plate for me, so it makes my job easier every time. Then Morgs [Gibbs-White] handed me the penalty for the hat-trick.\n\"It's fantastic. The boys have done superbly, showing character to come back from last week. That's what we are all about.\"\nOn his partnership with Elanga: \"We know the relationship that we have. We have that bond and that connection. He does superbly for me and it shows in the statistics.\n\"A hat-trick of assists never goes unnoticed. The boy is on flames.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cge7z18yg3po"}
