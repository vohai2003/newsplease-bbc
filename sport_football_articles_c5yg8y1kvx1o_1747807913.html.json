If you stand still, you are actually going backwards.\"\nNewcastle have already secured a route into Europe for next season, earning a Conference League play-off spot with their triumph at Wembley.\nHowever, they could yet earn a place in the group stage of the Europa League or the Champions League through their final Premier League position.\nGibson added: \"People like Isak, Bruno, Tonali, Joelinton and Gordon will want to stay with the initial reaction to what happened at Wembley. Let's give them more reasons to want to stay.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yg8y1kvx1o"}
