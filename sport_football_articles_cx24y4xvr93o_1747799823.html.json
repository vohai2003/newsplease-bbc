I want to see a reaction from the team, but we win together and we lose together. It is also a test, for the individual characters and for the group, to see how we deal with this. Games like this are bad, but maybe it is a signal for us to show a reaction.\n\"We said we wanted to play with courage. We wanted to play offensively and, in the end, you could say it was a mistake. In the end, we were not good enough.\n\"You need to have a balance between defence and controlling the ball in possession. We had some big chances and their goalkeeper was amazing. Out of possession, we were not on the field today.\"\nOn his five yellow cards in the Premier League: \"When we look at the decisions today, they were really poor so I think being emotional is part of it. I know the statistic but, in the end, emotions are part of the game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx24y4xvr93o"}
