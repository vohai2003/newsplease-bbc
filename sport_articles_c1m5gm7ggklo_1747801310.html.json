I made no illusions when I left the club as a 17-year-old that it was my dream to play for them again one day.\n\"As soon as I signed for Bristol, I said the only club that I would leave Bristol for was Celtic.\"\nHead coach Elena Sadiku added: \"We're very excited to bring Abi into our squad. She has great experience in both the Women's Super League and the Championship.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c1m5gm7ggklo"}
