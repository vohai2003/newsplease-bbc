We're really excited to have him coming over here as a young guy coming in with stacks to prove.\n\"He wants to win things. His story has already proven he's prepared to take the tough route to get to where he's been â€“ that really impresses me. I can only see bright things for him in the future.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c62j41x61ejo"}
