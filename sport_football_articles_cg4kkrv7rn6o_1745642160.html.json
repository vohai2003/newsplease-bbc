They almost expect to be winning the Conference League, as opposed to hoping that they do, because they look like the best team in that competition.\nThey have to make it to the final and win it. Yes, the fans will celebrate but probably not in the same way as they would have it was a bigger honour.\nAway from results is the conversation around Cole Palmer's form, which I think in the main is talked about too simplistically.\nIt is not like they have to give the ball to Palmer whenever they are attacking - it is just that the position he tends to find himself playing in is very important to their style of play.\nThe expectation should be on Palmer to score goals, alongside input from everyone else. Their worst case scenario is that their other players also have a dip in form at the same time.\nWhen Chelsea are at their best, it is because of the way they attack. It's free-flowing and fun to watch because of the speed of their wingers, attacking midfielders and forwards.\nIf they cannot find that attacking excitement anymore and they become a bit stale because Palmer is still out of form and others have not stepped up, then that would be the worst possible end to the season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cg4kkrv7rn6o"}
