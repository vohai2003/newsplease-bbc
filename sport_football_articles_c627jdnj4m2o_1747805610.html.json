McGinn needs another week before he returns to training, Barkley will be \"two- to-three weeks\" and Torres a further six-to-eight weeks.\nOn Villa's aims in the transfer window: \"We are trying to do some movement. We are alert, and we always want to be ready to improve our squad with the players and of course sometimes as well, some players want to leave for different circumstances.\"\nWith David Moyes taking charge of Everton for the first time since his return as manager, Emery noted: \"The crowd and Everton players will be very motivated. We have to try and focus on our match and our gameplan.\"\nOn Villa's away form given they have won only three of nine Premier League games on the road this season: \"Playing away [has been] more difficult. Our challenge is how we can compete away, because the last matches that we have played away in the Premier League, we didn't get any points.\"\nHe said the game provides a chance \"to try to change the bad results we have achieved\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c627jdnj4m2o"}
