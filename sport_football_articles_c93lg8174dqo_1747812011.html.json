He had it on his other knee and he felt it was the same, that's why he looked so desperate,\" he said.\n\"And that's the only downer for me. He's been exceptional.\"\nThe club confirmed the extent of the injury in a post on their official X account, external on Wednesday.\nSwindon have won six of their 27 League Two games and are 19th in the table.\nKirkman has made 22 appearances for the Robins this season, scoring one goal.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93lg8174dqo"}
