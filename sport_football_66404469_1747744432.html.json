It's nice to get it all sorted before the season starts and just allows me to focus on the football and hopefully have a positive season,\" Stephens told the club website., external\n\"I think over the summer there was a lot of uncertainty over what was going on.\n\"But I had some good conversations with the manager and he made it clear that he wanted me to stay and I've loved working with him these first few weeks.\n\"I'm really confident that we're going to have a good season, so it was an easy decision for me to sign the contract and I'm really happy.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66404469"}
