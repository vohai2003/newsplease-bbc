We suffered a setback, but we responded brilliantly.\n\"I thought the game-plan was executed perfectly for 80 minutes but then we had a really poor last 10 minutes.\n\"It was schoolboy stuff and we're much better than that. We've managed to see games out much more efficiently than that.\n\"It's disappointing as it feels like we've lost two points as the performance was so strong up to then.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y2zk3zjwpo"}
