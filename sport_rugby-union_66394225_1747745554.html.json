He's probably not going to change too much in the way that he approaches things.\n\"This week in training he's just been doing his normal job. He does that really well, he speaks very well and understands the game incredibly well.\n\"Everyone listens to him, everyone understands him, he's a fantastic leader and I'm really excited to get out there with him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/66394225"}
