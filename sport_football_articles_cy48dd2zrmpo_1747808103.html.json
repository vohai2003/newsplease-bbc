Bull's unmatched loyalty to the club feels like a relic of the past in modern football, where ambition far outweighs long-term commitment. His dedication to Wolves remains iconic, but the reality is stark - players like Bull may never emerge again.\nIn contrast, Wolves today seem more like a stepping stone for ambitious players looking to reach bigger clubs. Matheus Cunha, for instance, is already expected to move on this summer, reinforcing the perception that the club's custodians cannot match the ambition of their top talents.\nWhen bigger opportunities arise, players inevitably leave, exposing Wolves' limitations.\nWhile Cunha's creativity and technical skills stand out, it is worth questioning whether the team is stronger without relying on individual brilliance.\nRecent performances - like Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Jorgen Strand Larsen stepping up - show Wolves can thrive collectively. The squad's depth hints at potential, but also the inevitable transitions waiting ahead.\nThis summer is likely to bring significant changes, with key player sales expected to fund much-needed recruits.\nJorge Mendes' returning influence at the club alongside internal recruitment sparks some hope for strategic investment, potentially bringing in the quality required to stay competitive.\nHowever, this optimism is dampened by larger concerns about the club's ambition. Chairman Jeff Shi's comments last summer - that Wolves are not a trophy-driven club - only deepen the frustration.\nSuch a mindset risks alienating players and supporters alike, raising doubts about Wolves' desire to compete at the highest level. The fans' patience with mediocrity is wearing thin, and continues to cast a shadow over the club's future.\nAs Wolves move toward the end of the season, all eyes will be on Cunha's potential departure, inevitable squad changes and the club's direction.\nBut unless the custodians show more ambition and think bigger, Wolves may remain nothing more than a waypoint for players with bigger dreams.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy48dd2zrmpo"}
