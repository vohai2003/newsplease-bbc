It's not what the club is based on.\n\"There are still talented players out there that we want. There's still quite a way to go in the window, so we'll look to improve the squad again. We've done a lot of early business, and we want to do more.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cx7yyy46eeno"}
