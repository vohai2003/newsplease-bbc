He had a goal disallowed for offside as well.\n\"We've been playing like this all season,\" he said. \"We feel we've been playing well as a team. Sometimes we score five, sometimes two, sometimes we don't score but [on Tuesday] we did well. It all clicked.\"\nArsenal's lack of a recognised striker has been well documented, but six different players contributed to the rout.\nThe emphatic win means that Arsenal can start planning for a trip to Madrid, as they are set to take on the winner of the tie between Real and Atletico, which finished 2-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next week's second leg takes place at Atletico.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/czrnyj38em0o"}
