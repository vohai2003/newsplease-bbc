Brisbane was meant to be his destination.\nHe rowed for an average of 12 hours a day, according to local reports.\nHe regularly updated his progress on Instagram. In the latest post published a day before he called for help, Mr Mockus reported that he had crossed the Chesterfield Islands, a cluster of French coral islands about 1,500km east of Australia.\n\"The highlight is that I successfully sailed the reefs of Chesterfield Islands. And further as God allows... The most important thing is to hold back the next few days,\" he wrote.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred, which derailed Mr Mockus's plan, is forecast to hit Australia's eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales in the coming days.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20d1k1gjjvo"}
