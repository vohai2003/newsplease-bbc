But it was nothing to do with our attitude. We fought until the last second to get the equaliser,\n\"It's important to keep going and keep believing, we kept going and even after scoring we wanted to win the game.\n\"The points is from the character of the team, we know we can play better but sometimes it's not to perform at the best level but to fight and keep going until the last minute. It's a very important point.\n\"We were missing the accuracy in the final third, the final pass or cross was sloppy.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg2zn41ng1o"}
