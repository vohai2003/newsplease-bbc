I probably won't go riding my bike again,\" he said.\nCody has set up a fundraiser to try and recoup some of the money he spent on the bike.\nIt was a Sur-Ron electric motorbike worth Â£3,500, much of which he was paying back in instalments.\nHe does not expect to get it back but hopes action would be taken against those involved.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2err1x13zlo"}
