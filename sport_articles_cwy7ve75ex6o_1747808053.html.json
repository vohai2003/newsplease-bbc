Derek McInnes seems to relish doing the polar opposite of that.\nThe biggest worry for me on Saturday was the players didn't appear to be running themselves into the ground for the manager.\nWe have too many players whose contracts are running out, so how worried are they about where Killie finish?\nThe best-case scenario is to wish McInnes well for the future and bring in a fresh face for the closing games who may give us that new manager effect.\nMotherwell visit the Theatre of Pies on Saturday and we've run out of endless excuses - three points are needed.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cwy7ve75ex6o"}
