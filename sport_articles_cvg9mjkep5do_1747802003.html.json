We've created opportunities in the past and not finished them off.\n\"[Freddy Douglas] is an incredible talent. He's just going to get better with more time on the pitch.\n\"It's a massive opportunity [in the quarter-finals]. For us, it's back to work on Monday and trying to improve on this performance.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cvg9mjkep5do"}
