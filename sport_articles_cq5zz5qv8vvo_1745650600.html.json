Gray wants his team to keep improving and ramp it up in the five matches before the split. He stressed their next target is to catch third-place Aberdeen.\nThe Hibs boss is proud of his team for showing their character at Tannadice in midweek to win and and keep fighting to the end having gone a goal down.\nHe challenged his players to enjoy the derby and says these are the games you miss after you retire because of the atmosphere and what it means to the city - the memories \"live with you forever\".\nThe team that can be \"calm in the chaos\" tends to come out on top on derby day. Gray says you have to have the right mentality to thrive in these games.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cq5zz5qv8vvo"}
