It was a long rehabilitation process, I had to stay patient when I began to come back to fitness.\n\"I gave up my summer to work hard and get myself into this position so I am delighted to get some minutes under my belts today, and hopefully I kick on from this.\n\"Everything feels good, the physios have done great, the strength and conditioning coach has been brilliant with me and I feel strong and confident about everything right now.\n\"I am chomping at the bit to play. I obviously need to get more minutes under my belt but I need to be patient. I will see how I hold up recovery-wise and hopefully, I can be back playing competitively over the next few weeks.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crge94930kdo"}
