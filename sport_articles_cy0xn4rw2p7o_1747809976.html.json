Disappointed. We spoke before the game that this was an opportunity, at home, to get three points.\n\"We just didn't do enough within the game. At half time, the game was balanced and there was a fine line between who could win it.\n\"We fell foul of a set play, which we had a warning of five minutes prior, and we didn't take heed of that.\n\"Credit to Dundee United, they deserved the victory.\n\"We're at home and we want to play on the front foot and create chances. We had a couple in the first half but nowhere near enough.\n\"It was about doing the right things, making them defend, and we didn't do that. They did, that's why they're a top six team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy0xn4rw2p7o"}
