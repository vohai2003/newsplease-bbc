He is our club captain and one of our most important players.\n\"The first time I coached Christian, he was a number 10; now he is one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League.\n\"I'm very happy. Hopefully we can continue to be successful together with Christian leading the team.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3w1wj3nngvo"}
