The first was a header and the second was a shot, both from close range and both set up by the impressive Ryan Strain.\nMark O'Hara converted a penalty and Alex Gogic banged in the fourth goal following a corner on the stroke of half-time.\nThe Buddies will be among the unseeded sides when the last 16 draw is made on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cl4mdd2jm6eo"}
