Today they scored first, but we had some chances. In the second half, we increased our level and we started to feel we came here to win. It's not time to wait, it's time to play, press them and win the game. I was very happy with that.\n\"I don't care if we lose, I just want my team pressing and putting more pace on the ball and changing one or two things. It's a result because we played with quality in second half, creating opportunities.\n\"I don't know if it is guaranteed safety, but we will try to win the next game. We have a good team, personality, character and we are connected with the supporters. We have good players to score goals. It was a pity the goal we conceded but, in the end, I'm happy.\n\"Our pressure is the pressure we put on ourselves. At the end of the game, we need to feel we did our work. We tried to win the game and we didn't want to draw. We came with the intention to win. We tried to prepare to win the game.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2de3pp5x15o"}
