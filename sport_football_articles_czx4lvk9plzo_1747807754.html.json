While a fourth game this season against Aston Villa awaits at the end of the month in the cup, the other five league fixtures will be season-defining in their pursuit of a top-half finish and beyond.\nAside from Wednesday's away trip to Southampton, which carries a different sort of pressure as the de facto favourite on paper, each of the remaining matches is against a team from the top half of the table, each either occupying or within touching distance of European qualification.\nIf Glasner and his team are to stake their claim as contenders, these are precisely the fixtures they will need to win to establish themselves as one. With almost every team element clicking into place at the right time, there is no reason to believe they cannot do just that.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czx4lvk9plzo"}
