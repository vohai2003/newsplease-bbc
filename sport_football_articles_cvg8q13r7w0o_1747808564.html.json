I don't know if it's a confidence thing. For most of this season we've not been at the levels we know we can be. It's down to ourselves to try and change that moving forward and to try and win the game next week.\n\"It's difficult, I don't know if it's a confidence thing, we had so many players on the pitch when we went 2-0 up that are so good at keeping the ball. We've not been doing that recently.\n\"Credit to Paris, they were so good, very energetic. A lot better than I thought - I don't mean that in a bad way but they were top tonight, a really good team. I think they deserved to win.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg8q13r7w0o"}
