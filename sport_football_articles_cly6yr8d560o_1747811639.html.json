It's wonderful to have this calibre of coaches that are willing to come in for six weeks.\"\nThe new faces go straight in at the deep end at this weekend, with Swansea aiming to become only the second visiting team this season to win a second-tier game at Elland Road.\nSwansea have won only one of their past nine away matches, while Leeds have won 15 of their 19 home league fixtures in 2024-25.\nWhile his side will start as underdogs, Sheehan says Swansea's players have responded well to the new voices on the training ground.\n\"We've got a really good relationship with the players. They are very good to us, they give everything,\" he said.\n\"I think there's no question of their application and desire to work hard for each other.\n\"Yes we fell short against Burnley and I take ownership of that. Now we get ready for really a difficult test against Leeds, but in terms of the players, I think so highly of them.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly6yr8d560o"}
