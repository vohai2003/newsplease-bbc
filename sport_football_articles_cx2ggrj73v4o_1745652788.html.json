Chris Wood adding to his already decent numbers for this season and continuing to raise the energy in the City Ground will all help in qualifying for European football.\nAnd Champions League qualification would be fully deserved.\nBut going further, they can still finish second, and of course that would be the best scenario of a finish for them.\nEqually, my biggest fear is that they qualify for a Europe but drop several positions at the same time.\nForest will inevitably celebrate a place in any European competition, but if it is not the Champions League because they have dropped down the table then it is almost bitter-sweet.\nThankfully, there are not many teams that are playing better than Forest at the minute so there is no reason to believe that they won't be in the top four.\nAnd if they do earn a spot in Europe's biggest competition next season then they deserve the right to absolutely celebrate their achievements this season, especially given their recent history.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cx2ggrj73v4o"}
