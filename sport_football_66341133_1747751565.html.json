A win at home to Alloa secures top spot and in fact they'll be top regardless of their own score if Stirling Albion lose at St Johnstone.\nA bonus-point win would take Ayr to 10 points and would still be enough to qualify in second even if Stirling win. Even a defeat on penalties coupled with a Stirling win may be enough to go through as runners-up but a goal difference of only two might make that unlikely.\nFor Stirling, the only other team in the group who can still qualify, a victory in Perth would see them through in either first or second. A bonus-point win would put them top if Ayr lose and could be enough for a best-placed runner-up, although again their goal difference would only be two.\nThree teams still in the mix here but bizarrely current leaders Dundee United are not one of them, with just six points from four games.\nPartick Thistle and The Spartans meet at Firhill and find themselves in exactly the same boat. A win for either and they top the group. A bonus-point win would also be good enough if Falkirk fail to win or win by just one goal and and don't score enough to overturn the 'goals scored' column.\nA Falkirk victory by two goals or more against Peterhead puts them top IF Thistle and The Spartans draw.\nHamilton sit top, meaning a win over fellow-relegated side Cove Rangers ensures they will finish there. A bonus-point win would also keep them top if Livingston don't beat Clyde and if they do, an Accies bonus-point win would still send them through in second on 10 points.\nA Cove victory, though, would give them first place IF Livi don't get at least a bonus point and would put them in contention for a best-placed runners-up spot if Livi get two or three points, though Cove's victory would have to be pretty handsome given their current goal difference is minus one.\nAs for Livingston, they'll win the group with a victory if Accies fail to win. The same is true of a bonus-point win if Accies lose or lose on penalties. Livi would qualify in second if both they and Accies triumph and a bonus point would still have them looking good in the event of an Accies win because of their impressive goal difference of plus eight.\nAnother group in which three teams still have ambitions of qualification. But clearly after three straight wins, Ross County are best placed to go through, needing only a point at home to Kelty Hearts to clinch first place.\nThey could even win the group with a narrow defeat but that will depend on Morton's goal difference. Dougie Imrie's men are currently second and know only a victory at home to Edinburgh City and a Kelty win in Dingwall as well as a sufficient goal-difference swing will give them top spot. A victory would at least put them in contention to qualify in second, especially if they can notch a few goals.\nKelty, for their part, need to win by three to leapfrog County and would then win the group if Morton don't win by more than one goal. A Kelty win by fewer than three may be enough to qualify second if Morton win by two or fewer (unless they score more than Kelty in doing so) or indeed fail to win.\nAnything other than a Motherwell defeat at home to East Fife will mean Stuart Kettlewell's side finish top. But the Fifers know a win would take them above Well into first. A bonus-point win would leave them second behind their hosts on goal difference and although they would have nine points, a goal difference of plus two seems unlikely to be enough to progress.\nIncredibly, League 2 Forfar are one of only three teams with maximum points so far and anything other than a defeat in Paisley guarantees them first place.\nSt Mirren are three points behind with the same goal difference of plus four, so they know a win takes them above Ray McKinnon's visitors. If Forfar were to lose narrowly, they would still have a chance of being one of the best-placed runners-up.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66341133"}
