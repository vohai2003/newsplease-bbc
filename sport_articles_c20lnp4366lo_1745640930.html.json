Mistakes galore.\nSenior players Jack Butland and James Tavernier made big errors leading to goals and then the team huffed and puffed but couldn't pull back the latest two-goal deficit.\nThere are nine league games to go and I'm hoping we get more more away matches after the split because going to Ibrox is an absolute chore.\nAs for Fenerbahce on Thursday, I don't have much hope of a result. It's going to be really difficult considering the shape we are in.\nThe only news that's keeping me slightly positive for the future is the takeover. It's badly needed and hopefully it goes through as soon as possible, so the new owners can start gutting this squad.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c20lnp4366lo"}
