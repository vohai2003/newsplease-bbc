Eberechi Eze is on fire for club and country and Ismaila Sarr found the target again in Saturday's FA Cup win over Fulham.\nSarr has gone under the radar a bit but he is one of many Palace players to have hit form, and I don't see Southampton keeping them out.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy708krx576o"}
