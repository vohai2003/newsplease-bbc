So now it is just about finishing strong and recovering some familiar faces.\nHopefully, in the coming weeks we will see Bukayo Saka and, as a consequence, a return of the exciting football we have seen from this side in recent seasons.\nIf they can do that, then there could be a Champions League run to be made and reaching the final would give them something to play for.\nLiverpool look like they are going to win the league, but Arsenal still look like the second-most consistent team.\nFinishing strongly domestically has to be an aim because belief among the fans and the players can make a big difference going into next season.\nWhere you finish is one thing - but the way you finish is another.\nA win at Anfield in the closing stages of the season would also be a big statement and a boost of belief going into pre-season and the next campaign. Finishing strong breeds hope.\nThat leads me on to my biggest fear.\nMy main concern is what would happen if Arteta's men are knocked out of the Champions League in the coming weeks as that would then mean they finish the season just going through the motions.\nThat is against what Arteta stands for and it will be a huge sense of disappointment for all involved if it all fizzes out. That feeling leads to the question of what next? Because this season has been another opportunity missed in the sense that people - including me - expected Arsenal to be right in the mix.\nHaving nothing to play for in the final two or three months of the season would be more of a cause of concern and lead to questions about the future rather than just the present.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/clyjjq7ez4yo"}
