Relegation? Hardly. A cycle is over. Let's enjoy the process and keep the faith. Top-10 finish with some exciting glimpses of the future is all we need this year. Good luck, Harry. We both need to move on.\nTony: I'm concerned for Spurs, I can't see an improvement in the team in terms of signings. Whilst our rivals are out making big statement signings, we're still shopping in the bargain basement. Levy seems to be the dark cloud at the club. This farce over Kane is not helping, either sell or don't but please make a decision soon so we can move on.\nAlexander: These are uncertain times for Spurs. However, rebuilding has started under new management and needs to be given a chance. Kane cost Spurs nothing and is a credit to his profession. With or without him, Spurs will survive.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0j4ydlekl0o"}
