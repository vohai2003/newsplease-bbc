This is nothing. I've only been here 20 minutes, I could stay another two hours or four. Whatever it takes.\"\nUnfortunately, Taylor missed Taylor.\nMargaret and Barbie from New Orleans went to eat at the restaurant and got a surprise.\n\"We walked in and Taylor Swift and all of her entourage were behind a screen,\" said Margaret shortly after leaving the restaurant. \"They've just left and snuck out the back.\"\n\"Through the kitchen!\" Barbie added.\nMargaret continued: \"There were like a thousand people outside waiting for her and she snuck out the back. And they're still all there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c8xq22ygexgo"}
