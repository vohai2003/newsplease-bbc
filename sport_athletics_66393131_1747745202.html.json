If you don't slow down, things could get worse,\" he added, speaking to Belgian newspaper Le Soir.\nThiam, who missed recent Diamond League meetings in Monaco and London, pulled out after two heptathlon events at her national championships.\nShe set a pentathlon world record at the European Indoor Athletics Championships in Istanbul in March, scoring 5,055 points.\nA total of 6,947 points clinched her second heptathlon world title in Eugene last year, ahead of the Netherlands' Anouk Vetter and American Anna Hall.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/66393131"}
