I think it's a bit of a cop out when you find energy in the 75th minute.\n\"We're not prepared to do the tough stuff at the moment.\n\"We've got some things to fix up and learning to do. We've got to have some harsh words. Some of the players are making the same mistakes week after week. We need to learn soon or it's going to be a long year.\n\"We start ok but as soon we get tired and get under pressure we crack. We're lacking toughness. The players care and they're trying their best but when we get put under pressure we struggle.\"\nHull FC head coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\"I was a bit worried coming into the game with a few injuries from last game and an enormous game coming up next weekend. I was hoping we could turn up here and do a job and then worry about next week and I think we did that to a fair degree.\n\"It became a bit of a slogfest towards the end but we came here to get a win on the board and we did that.\n\"I was disappointed with the last two tries\n\"The toll is starting to mount up injuries wise. We'd like to go one a run where we can start and finish a game as planned.\n(On Ese'ese extending his deal) \"It's massive for the club, I think he's the form front-rower in Super League at the moment. He's good to have around the club, never misses training and plays big minutes.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/articles/czxnv81ryjvo"}
