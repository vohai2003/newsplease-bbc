They are in the mix for a European place but are also having to look over their shoulder with the relegation play-off place a concerning vision in their rear-view mirror.\nTony Docherty's team have shown enough of late to suggest they will be able to get themselves away from things at the wrong end of the table.\nBut, like a number of other teams in a similar predicament, that lingering concern will remain hovering on the horizon until they do.\nWhile things certainly didn't go according to plan here – with players like Lyall Cameron and Josh Mulligan in their ranks – you do feel it wont be too long before Dundee find themselves back winning.\nBut the manner of this defeat will undoubtedly be a real cause for concern for Docherty, who must find a way of lifting his players for their daunting-looking midweek trip to Celtic.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz7ey0wjnnxo"}
