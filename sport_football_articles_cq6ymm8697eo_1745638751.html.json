There's still 90 minutes to play, we're ready in case we need extra-time and penalties because I know how difficult it is in each match and how we can change one match in 90 minutes.\n\"The players - I'm sure they have experiences before as well with matches like that and we have to respect the opponent always.\n\"There are still 90 minutes to play. They won against Atalanta 3-1 and they compete very well.\n\"We need to watch the match again with the players to understand the difficulties we can face against teams in Europe.\n\"I am happy but calm, getting balance. There are still 90 minutes to play.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cq6ymm8697eo"}
