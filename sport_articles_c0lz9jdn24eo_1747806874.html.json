We already caused a giant killing against Dryburgh.\n\"Financially, it's not going to give us a lot but for us it is the pride in it.\n\"For the first time we are taking a coachload of fans down, we're hoping for about 150 fans to be there.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0lz9jdn24eo"}
