A quick break saw Jevani Brown go clear on the left and a low cross fell to the feet of Thomas, who confidently drove home.\nPompey produced two good efforts from Colby Bishop and Gavin Whyte as they pressed for an equaliser.\nThe second half saw the home side coming out all guns blazing and the same pair again caused problems. Whyte had a stunning strike pushed over by Matthew Cox within the first two minutes, followed quickly by a Bishop header that missed the target.\nIt appeared Rovers were going to hold on but Yengi headed home the equaliser two minutes into added time.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66345552"}
