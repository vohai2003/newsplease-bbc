He made mistakes and opponents targeted him.\nIn his previous 78 games, he had never scored. But he did that night and it was the moment that changed a season.\nThe goal probably kept Gray in a job, given defeat would have left them languishing at the bottom of the table.\nHowever, since then, only Celtic have been able to get the better of Gray and his team and a third-place finish is now a distinct possibility.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g9p8vpm8eo"}
