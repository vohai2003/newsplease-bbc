They are obviously going to be really competitive, but looking at the table, I think they can all beat each other. I genuinely do.\n\"That result, everybody was probably looking at St Johnstone thinking they're down and out. You're not expecting them to get anything off Celtic, they're not going to get three points.\n\"St Johnstone are more than capable of picking up seven, eight, nine points out of 15, the other three or four are more than capable as well. If you're in that mix, you've got a wee bit of squeaky bum time.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn0w4yxyk0zo"}
