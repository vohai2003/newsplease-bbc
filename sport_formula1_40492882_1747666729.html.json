So more can come from me.\n\"It is a good feeling. It is something I was not expecting, to deliver so good straight away.\n\"This gives me, not confidence, because I knew as a drive the skills are there, but a relief that can do it physically, that I can make the job.\n\"I still know there is a long way to go and I need to do it step by step. If I have an opportunity, I will try to do my best. If not, I will search for something else. It has been a long time away from the circuit.\n\"When you get to an F1 car and after one lap you see the pace is there, it is special emotions and I miss it so much. I am enjoying the moment because I have been through difficult days - but I could never believe I could be in this position four or five months ago.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/40492882"}
