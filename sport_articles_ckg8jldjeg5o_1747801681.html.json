It was just too much to give away those three pretty soft goals. It cost us the whole match.\n\"Our level goes up and down too much. We can't put it all together for 90 minutes. That's why [we are bottom].\n\"We only have the players we have now. We don't know what the future holds. We just need to be better in key moments.\n\"We have known if we don't perform or get results, relegation is a big possibility. Yes, it looks very, very bad, but if we don't believe in ourselves, no-one will believe in us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/ckg8jldjeg5o"}
