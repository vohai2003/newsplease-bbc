The club is set to return to the United States next summer as part of the Premier League's pre-season tournament, beginning in late July, after the Club World Cup has concluded.\nWhile nothing is signed off yet, it is almost certain United will head to the Far East for two fixtures against opposition yet to be agreed.\nThere is a window of a week between the last match against Aston Villa on 25 May and the Champions League final on 31 May, after which players have to be released for international duty.\nUnited have a massive fan base in Malaysia and Malaysia Airlines is the club's official commercial airline partner.
