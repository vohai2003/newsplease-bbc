I don't think any of us knew him really well, but not in a standoffish way. He just kept himself to himself but was always very friendly and obviously a terrific player.\"\nOn the goal in the 1979 European Cup final: \"It was not just the skill to score it but also the energy to get in there. He told me afterwards he was scared that if he didn't get there, Cloughy would give him a right telling off!\n\"That was a fairytale for Trevor - and for the rest of us.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c51v0402qzzo"}
