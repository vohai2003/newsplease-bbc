I really feel for my players. I think we deserved a point. In the first half West Brom did more for the game, but it was ok for me, today.\n\"We changed the game with the subs. A draw would have been fantastic today, and deserved.\n\"We had the chance to take a point here, but at the end we conceded a goal from a set-piece. It's hard to take.\n\"We believed we could do something. In the first half we had a little too much respect sometimes.\"\nOn the disallowed Djeidi Gassama goal, he said: \"I never complain about decisions, it is what it is, it's football, but to take a goal back after 16 seconds is a little bit hard to take. It's not really clear for me.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8qrjm360yo"}
