Can't understand guys wanting to leave the best team in the world.\nSean: A good run out, James McAtee looks like he should fit in to first team set-up this season and Oscar Bobb looks promising. Nice to see Joao Cancelo playing. I just hope he's got his attitude straight.\nChris: Good early workout against a good side. First game of pre-season so naturally players will be getting back to match sharpness in coming weeks. Great squad which is likely to improve before transfer window closes.\nLyn: Some really good performances from the B team. I thought Cancelo was excellent and I hope he stays.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c6pr70wvyypo"}
