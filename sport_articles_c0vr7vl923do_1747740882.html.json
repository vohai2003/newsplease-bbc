Those at the club hope that Mickey van de Ven will solve that problem and create a new partnership with Cristian Romero.\nAt right-back, Kieran Trippier has not really been replaced since he left for Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2019.\nI would not say it has been all bad.\nGoalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario may be an upgrade on Hugo Lloris after his list of errors last season. Manor Solomon was very effective for Fulham and is an improvement on club legend, Lucas Moura who has gone back to Brazil.\nDestiny Udogie will make his debut for Spurs after signing 12 months ago. He will go in at left-back ahead of Ben Davies and Sergio Reguillon.\nDejan Kulusevski signed a permanent deal in the summer for a reduced fee of Â£25m from Juventus. That is a good deal.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c0vr7vl923do"}
