It makes them happy; it makes me happy that my dreams are becoming a reality.\n\"The last two seasons have been great, but it is just the beginning for me.\"\nCity have also signed 19-year-old Brazilian defender Vitor Reis from Palmeiras for £30m and Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens for £34m in the January transfer window.\nMarmoush, who has played as a striker, a number 10 and a winger, said: \"On the pitch I am fast, good on the ball, I try to see where the spaces are and exploit the spaces - and I'm dangerous.\n\"My main strength I would say is that I always want to win - that is from a character point of view.\"\nCity director of football Txiki Begiristain said Marmoush has \"outstanding pace and awareness\" and that his versatility is a \"really valuable asset\".\nMarmoush began his career with Wadi Degla in the Egyptian Premier League, before signing for VfL Wolfsburg in 2020.\nHe had loan spells at FC St Pauli and VfB Stuttgart before his 2023 move to Frankfurt, for whom he scored 37 goals and made 20 assists in 67 games.\nSimon Stone, chief football news reporter\nManager Pep Guardiola admitted a couple of weeks ago he made a mistake not following the advice of senior figures at City in the summer by refreshing his squad. Now we are seeing the result of that self-reflection.\nMarmoush's arrival is slightly different to those of Reis and Khusanov in that the Egyptian is filling the void left by the sale of Julian Alvarez to Atletico Madrid rather than to eventually replace older players, with time to bed in.\nIt has been clear for most of the season that Erling Haaland needed someone to share the burden of responsibility for scoring goals and threatening the opposition.\nMarmoush is that man.\nHe has scored 20 goals in all competitions for Frankfurt over the first half of the campaign.\nWhile it remains to be seen how Marmoush links with Haaland, who signed his own mammoth nine-and-a-half-year deal last week, Guardiola will at least feel he has more attacking options for the remainder of the campaign.\nMarmoush is expected to be available for Saturday's Premier League game with Chelsea, although he cannot be registered for next week's crucial Champions League encounter with Club Brugge, which City must win to secure a play-off berth.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2kxyyd8e0o"}
