They have won 11 of the 16 matches in their unbeaten run and show no sign of slowing, having been bottom in November.\nThis is their first win at Ibrox since February 2018, when John McGinn and Jamie Maclaren were on the scoresheet.\nThey were solid at the back, with Rocky Bushiri particularly impressive in the way he subdued Cyriel Dessers, and they also excelled in midfield, with Nectarios Triantis a model of composure and quality, ably assisted by Dylan Levitt, who got the ball rolling.\nHibs were a constant threat on the break, sitting in a solid defensive shape before utilising their strength and pace up top to hurt Rangers time and time again.\nIt is a result and performance which will give David Gray every confidence his side can maintain third spot and give European football a good crack next season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cg5q253gy86o"}
