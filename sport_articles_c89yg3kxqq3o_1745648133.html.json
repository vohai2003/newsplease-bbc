O'Callaghan hit five points during this period and set up Lorcan O'Dell's goal.\nHowever, Armagh steadied the tide with a score from McCabe and grabbed four of the last six points of the day to see out the win.\nThe result moves them three points above the relegation zone with Tyrone and Derry still to play on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c89yg3kxqq3o"}
