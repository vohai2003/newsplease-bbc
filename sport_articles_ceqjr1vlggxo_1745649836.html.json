It's not the first time we've said that this season, which comes as a surprise given the reputation that Kilmarnock have built under McInnes.\nNow, there seems to be a softer underbelly that plenty of Premiership opponents have taken advantage of.\nTo rub salt in the wound, Kyle Magennis didn't last long after coming on.\nTrying to jockey Noah Chilvers, the Killie midfielder seemed to twist his knee in the turf and was immediately replaced. Not what anyone wants to see for a player who has suffered so many injury problems.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/ceqjr1vlggxo"}
