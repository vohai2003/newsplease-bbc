I certainly wouldn't preclude rate cuts. China is facing the difficult task of trying to move from a heavy-growth and commodity-using economy to a consumer, service sector-oriented economy,\" he added.\n\"I'm still sceptical they will be able to bring down that credit and housing bubble without collateral damage, such as a rather big hit to growth.\"\nSurveys released earlier this week suggested that China's manufacturing sector remained under pressure in January.\nThe official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector fell to 49.8, down from 50.1 in December. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.\nThat echoed a private HSBC/Markit PMI survey, which fell to 49.7 in January.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31129473"}
