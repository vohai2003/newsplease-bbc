The team can play absolutely superbly one week then get beaten, no matter how well we play the next. Our consistency needs to improve.\nDouglas: This result probably relegates us to the bottom six, not that the possession or the quality of outfield play deserves that prediction, but we now really depend on others helping us get there. The manager is spot on, you can't doubt the effort or at times the skill, but if you don't take your chances then you deserve to lose.\nJohn: We played well, but our goalkeeper's mistake for their second goal gave us a mountain to climb. Top six is probably gone now, but even so we've done okay considering the multiple setbacks this season.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c5yp6l0z18eo"}
