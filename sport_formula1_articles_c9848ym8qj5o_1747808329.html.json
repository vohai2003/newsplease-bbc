It seems like they'd be losing the only person who can drive their car, a situation that's seemingly self-inflicted. Are they likely to be making their 2026 car more driveable to mitigate this risk? - Tom\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Lawson-Tsunoda driver swap is that it gives another perspective on the state Red Bull are in with their car.\nVerstappen believes it is the fourth quickest car in F1 at the moment - so behind the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. Although on average qualifying pace in the three sessions so far, it is actually second fastest behind the McLaren.\nBut it may be that it is only both of those things with Verstappen in it.\nThe issue for Red Bull is that they have one genius-level driver and one average one, in F1 terms - and that remains the case with Tsunoda in the second seat, or at least that's what most would believe right now.\nSo it's almost a case of split the difference between the drivers to judge the level of the car.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the new Red Bull is simply not that good a car, and certainly one which is unpredictable and does not generate confidence in a driver. Even Verstappen finds it difficult to drive - but he is so good that he is able to coax a good lap time out of it.\nVerstappen is regarded by most as the best driver in F1 at the moment - so if that's true, it stands to reason that the car would be worse with pretty much anyone else in it.\nIt seems Red Bull may have chased peak aerodynamic performance at the expense of drivability - which would be ironic, because that is exactly the opposite of the philosophy that Adrian Newey has championed throughout his career.\nLegendary designer Newey, who stopped working on Red Bull in F1 last April, and has just come to the end of his first month with Aston Martin, has always believed that it was better to have slightly less downforce that the driver can use all of, than more theoretical downforce that can't be accessed because the car is too \"peaky\". Or, as Lawson put it, the \"window\" is too narrow.\nLike all teams, Red Bull designed the best car they could for the new season. The question that hangs over them now is, do they know how to fix it?\nAfter another very dry sprint race in China I wonder again why F1 doesn't give the teams tyres that enables the drivers to race through a sprint. Surely the point of the sprint is it is fast, exciting and full of action? - Richard\nThis is a question about tyre management. The fact is that - with a few very limited exceptions - drivers have never been able to race flat out since Pirelli entered F1 as the tyre supplier in 2011.\nThat's not how their tyres work. Pirelli tyres have to be managed to stay within a temperature window.\nDrive them flat out and they overheat. And if they overheat, they rarely come back to optimum grip level. Sometimes this is even the case over a single qualifying lap.\nPirelli has been asked before to provide tyres that can be driven flat out, but so far it has not done so.\nIs there a circuit(s) you'd really want on the calendar that currently isn't on there? And at the expense of which current circuit(s)? I love Fuji and I'm not a fan of street circuits â€“ RAP\nThe F1 calendar has a pretty good selection of circuits at the moment.\nThere are some obvious candidates in the United States - Road America and Laguna Seca are both great circuits. But then so is Austin, and both Miami and Las Vegas work for the sport on a financial level.\nBathurst in Australia is awesome - but not suitable for F1, sadly.\nAs for Fuji, great backdrop, when the clouds are not covering Mount Fuji, but as a circuit it is not a patch on Suzuka.\nThe one big miss in terms of the calendar is France. Somehow, it seems wrong not to have a grand prix in the country that gave birth to motorsport and hosted the first race with that title, even if Monaco is regarded as a sort of proxy French race.\nThe problem is that France's only circuits with licences for F1 are Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. Uninspiring both.\nBut if the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans could be brought up to F1 standard and host a grand prix, that would be quite something.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c9848ym8qj5o"}
