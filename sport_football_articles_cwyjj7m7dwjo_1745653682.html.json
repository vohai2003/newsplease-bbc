Thomas Frank is a good manager. I thought we were at least worthy of a point today. Beto had three one-one ones with the goalkeeper and we did not score any of them\n\"I was really disappointed with the players at half-time because we concede from a set-piece that way. We try to prepare for it but did not deal with it very well.\n\"The game was really slow in the first half. I thought it suited us. We had the best chances with Beto through on goal. In the second half, we saw a lot more of the ball and we were the bigger threat in the second.\"\nOn upturn in the club's form: \"I don't really want to be someone who comes in to save the club from relegation. I want to be a manager who competes for Europe like I have been in three years prior to this.\n\"But, let's be honest. Everton were in a terrible position. We are looking up rather than down. We have been disappointed with getting a draw tonight and should have picked up more on Saturday.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cwyjj7m7dwjo"}
