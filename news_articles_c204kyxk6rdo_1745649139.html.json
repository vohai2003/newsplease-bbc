But invasive species such as rhododendron, as well as trees severely affected by ash dieback, needed to be removed.\nA spokesperson for the charity said the restoration project was the \"second largest we have ever undertaken in England\".\nThe Woodland Trust said it had raised enough money to purchase the forest following an appeal last year but it still needed millions more to enable them to manage the site for the next 20 years.\nDavid Logan, who is the site manager at the charity, said the woodland was home to a number of rare species, including the white admiral butterfly, and one of only four known pairs of nesting ravens in Lincolnshire.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c204kyxk6rdo"}
