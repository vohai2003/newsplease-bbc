Perhaps a move closer to loved ones would help with that.\nHe's also an ambitious coach. He will have been stung by his 11-game spell at Greek top-flight side Olympiakos, which ended shortly before he arrived at The Hawthorns, so this is his first real opportunity to work at an elite level.\nLike all Spanish clubs, Valencia are on a winter break but his first game in charge would be a home match against Real Madrid on 3 January. A day later, Albion travel to Swansea in a 12:30 kick-off, so you can understand the pull.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgrn9w5kgyo"}
