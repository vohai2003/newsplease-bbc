Good learning. I want to play against the best teams. That is how you will learn and develop. As long as I keep doing what I am doing hopefylly I will get many opportunities.\n\"The main goal is playing, get as many games as I can, keep impressing the gaffer when I can. The only thing I can do now is impress in training. These games like this matter for me as I get an oportunity and run out. As long as I keep doing what I am doing, hopefully I get opportunities.\"\nAsked what David Moyes is calling on him to do in matches he replied: \"Keep hold of the ball, get the ball higher up the pitch, work hard, do the dirty stuff. That's stuff I have in my game already.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cz7jj3p6n1ro"}
