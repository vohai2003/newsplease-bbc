Some had previously received a 50% discount.\nFans behind the dugouts will also be relocated, allowing the club to convert those seats for hospitality and sell them at premium prices while the minimum usage requirement for season ticket holders increases from 15 to 16 of their 19 Premier League home games.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj9e19ze2zdo"}
