North Korea and Russia did not comment.\nThe South Korean intelligence agency also said on Thursday that North Korean troops already in Russia had been re-deployed to the front line in Kursk at the start of February \"after about a month of lull\".\nUkrainian special forces fighting in Kursk told the BBC in January that they had not seen any North Korean troops for weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later confirmed they had returned to the front line.\nEarlier reports attributed to South Korean intelligence suggested that the North Korean soldiers were unprepared for modern warfare, and were especially vulnerable to Ukrainian drones.\nHowever, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2rreg04dpo"}
