Long balls to Ronan Hale and Kieran Phillips on a bumpy pitch failed, so bringing on Jordan White and George Robeston made sense as that was obviously the way we were going to continue to play.\nOur keeper kept us in the game first half. Bottom line, Akil Wright's blunder cost us. He has been so good for us, but this was a must-not-lose game and we were awful.\nAnon: Do we have a defence? If we have a so one, have they played in these positions before at this level? Every time, we shoot ourselves in the foot. Hang your heads lads, hang your heads.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c8e7d3pzn26o"}
