At 1-1 it was anyone's game, but it seemed we gave up.\nI am a firm believer that you always keep fighting even if you fall two or three goals behind. However, the team seem to lack that mindset.\nWhile there is still a slim chance we will sneak a top-six finish, I don't see it happening any more.\nStill, to even have a chance - and make up for the Pittodrie defeat - we need to respond strongly against Kilmarnock this weekend.\nTheir form lately has been shocking, but the number of times I have seen a team down on their luck use us as a springboard back to success means I won't hold my breath.\nThe only thing giving me slight optimism is in the 2021-2022 season we somehow crawled our way into the top six with fewer than five league wins from January to April and qualified for a (albeit very short) run in Europe.\nI'll be watching Saturday's game with frayed nerves while biting my nails.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cpvr2x3vkm2o"}
