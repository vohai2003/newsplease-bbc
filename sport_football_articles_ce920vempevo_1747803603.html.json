So I'll get straight to it and let you all know that these will be my final months as a Manchester City player.\nNothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here - and you deserve to hear it from me first.\nFootball led me to all of you - and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This city. This club. These people... gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what - we won EVERYTHING.\nWhether we like it or not, it's time to say goodbye. Suri, Rome, Mason, Michele, and I are beyond grateful for what this place has meant to our family.\n\"Manchester\" will forever be on our kids' passportsâ€” and more importantly, in each of our hearts.\nThis will always be our HOME.\nWe cannot thank the city, club, staff, team-mates, friends, and family enough for this 10-year ride.\nEvery story comes to an end, but this has definitely been the best chapter.\nLet's enjoy these last moments together!\nMuch love,\nKDB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce920vempevo"}
