It's just the volume of traffic that the pitch has had on it with football and rugby. The climate has also been challenging.\"\nSwansea share their ground with rugby side Ospreys, as they have done since the Swansea.com Stadium - previously known as the Liberty Stadium - opened in 2005.\nThe surface has won various awards for its quality, most recently in 2019, the same year in which the Swans spent more than Â£500,000 on renewing the pitch at base level for the first time since the stadium was built.\nYet the surface had to be relaid midway through the 2020-21 season with the club indicating it had been hit by disease the previous autumn.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1m5ggr3mjzo"}
