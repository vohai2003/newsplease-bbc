I wish Newcastle had taken him - he is a special player.\n\"Palace lost him and also Joachim Andersen, because of his age and the way the deal was to Fulham. The last thing they wanted to do was lose Guehi, who is a super professional.\n\"Speaking to the chairman [Steve Parish], he didn't want him to leave and he said the fee was £70m because he didn't want it done. Newcastle were in for him, Liverpool looked at the fee and said it was too much, but Newcastle came back.\n\"What I said to Steve was: 'You wanted £70m, but hang on to him as much as you can, because you'll still get £50m when he's got a year left [on his contract] at the end of the season. You'll lose £20m but you'll gain £130m because you'll stay in the league'.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clye3k502ylo"}
