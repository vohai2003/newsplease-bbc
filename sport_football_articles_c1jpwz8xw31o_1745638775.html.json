When you get opportunities and have top players that can take them, it makes a difference.\"\nEx-Villa striker Garry Thompson, speaking on BBC Radio WM:\n\"You'd have taken 1-1, you definitely would have taken 2-1 so for it to be 3-1 is absolutely magnificent.\n\"I feel sorry for Brugge a little bit, but this is the nature of the beast. You're playing with the big boys - you make mistakes, you get caught.\n\"Fair play to Villa, it's not the greatest night of football they've played but they've defended well and got the goals when they needed to get the goals. Unai Emery will be delighted with the way it's gone.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1jpwz8xw31o"}
