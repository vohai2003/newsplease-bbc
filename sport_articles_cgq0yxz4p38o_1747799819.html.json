We stuck to our game plan,\" he said.\n\"We were really resilient without the ball and we had a good shape. We really dug in towards the end.\"\nThe draw moves Dundee above St Mirren into seventh place, and Donnelly believes the disappointment in the dressing room following the match shows the strong mentality within the squad.\n\"Celtic are top opposition with top players. We showed how we can compete in this league and climb up it,\" he added.\n\"We were really disappointed not to get three points and that shows the way this club is going.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cgq0yxz4p38o"}
