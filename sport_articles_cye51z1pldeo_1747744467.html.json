They will be different styles against teams from two different leagues. It will be a really good test for us.\"\nOn what fans can expect: \"It will hopefully be a great spectacle and no doubt there will be a really good atmosphere. It’s great to be back home as it feels like a long time since we played at St James’ Park. We intend to play two balanced and competitive XIs.\"\nHe gave no indication on Tino Livramento’s potential arrival at the club: \"I am slightly in the dark on that but I certainly like the player.\"\nHe is happy with his squad but always would like more: \"It is leaner than last year currently but not in a negative way. We do not want a huge squad as we want everyone to feel involved. We will need everybody.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cye51z1pldeo"}
