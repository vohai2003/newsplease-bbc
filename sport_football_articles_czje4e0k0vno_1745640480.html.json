We sorted some things out and we did much better. We built our attacking moments really well.\n\"The way the team played in the second half and all of extra time makes me really proud because we came here and we were the dominant team. We were brave and we did it in our way.\n\"It was a big fight. I loved the composure of our own players.\"\nOn the penalty shootout: \"It is really important. They did it perfectly, with great composure, all of them. They have smiles on their faces.\n\"The Fulham fans are really proud of their team. We are there.\"\nOn whether Fulham deserved to win in 90 minutes: \"I think so, yes. I know they had chances but I think we were the best team on the pitch. Our team was on the ball, dominating the ball. We deserve to be in the next stage.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/czje4e0k0vno"}
