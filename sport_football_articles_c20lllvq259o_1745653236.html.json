They were just stroking it around. Everything we did was rushed and hurried whereas they seemed to be in total control of everything they did.\"\nAnderson was particularly frustrated about Bruno Guimaraes' performance, adding: \"I think he has been awful lately. There was times [against Liverpool] where he looked like he couldn't run. He was chasing shadows at times - [Ibrahima] Konate strolled past him as if he wasn't there. He looked like he had no legs at all.\n\"I think he has been poor for a while. Some players are poor and get absolutely battered for it and some players are poor and no one mentions it.\"\nDid you know?\nGuimaraes won possession back only once - a low mark he shared with several players. Meanwhile, Sandro Tonali regained possession nine times for Newcastle while Dominik Szobozslai did so eight times.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c20lllvq259o"}
