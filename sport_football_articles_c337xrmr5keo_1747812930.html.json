The one with the highest revenue, or the greatest social media following? The biggest stadium, or the best average league position? Or perhaps it's a happy medium of all those things.\nMost importantly, it's a debate nobody can win, one we all have a different take on and will all be offended by no matter how convincing someone's argument may be.\nTo bring the most unserious of serious topics to life, BBC Sport recently asked about 250 of its staff across the UK to take on the unanswerable question.\nThere were a lot of arguments. And a lot of unhappy people.\nBut at the end we averaged out the lists and came up with a top 10 below.\nAgree with it? Of course you don't.\nNo doubt many of you will feel enraged at where your club has ended up. So please, all we ask is that you remember a) this is an average and there were lots of different versions b) we're not saying we're right c) you can leave your top 10 below and d) it's just a bit of fun.\nTraditionally, clubs are deemed big if they win things.\nWhen it comes to major trophies, Glasgow giants Celtic and Rangers lead the way with significantly more silverware than any side in the English game.\nLiverpool are the most successful club in England, with Manchester United a close second - and the Reds look likely to equal United's record 20 top-flight titles this season.\nThey also have more European trophies than any other English side while Arsenal have the leading FA Cup tally.\nManchester City's recent dominance has shot them up the rankings, winning six of the past seven Premier League titles and securing a historic Treble in 2022-23.\nOf course, trophies are subjective and it might be that you think European titles are bigger than domestic ones or vice versa.\nSome of the more traditional among you may disregard social media followings as a bit of a gimmick.\nBut it does give us a good indication of just how big a reach clubs have not just in this country but globally, as well as their ability to engage fans.\nManchester United have the highest combined social media following across the four major platforms, while some clubs fare better on individual platforms.\nManchester City have a lower combined social following than their city rivals but fare better on Tik Tok while Tottenham are sixth overall but have the best Tik Tok following of any club.\nThe traditional 'top six' occupy the top spots but Leicester City's title win in 2015-16 boosted their profile globally and puts them seventh in the ranking.\nIf big club means big stadium to you then it's Manchester United who sit top of the pile.\nWembley is currently the largest, with a 90,000 capacity but Old Trafford is the biggest club stadium and United have also also announced plans to build an arena bigger than Wembley - a new Â£2bn 100,000-seater ground close to it.\nEverton's new Bramley Moore Dock stadium will be ranked seventh in the top 10 once it is in use from next season with a capacity of 52,888 while Manchester City are undergoing an expansion that will increase Etihad Stadium's capacity to 61,474.\nThough Queen's Park play their home matches at Hampden Park, which has a capacity in excess of the Stadium of Light, the ground is not fully open for Scottish Championship matches, with an average crowd this season of less than 2,000.\nNow it's time to have your say using the ranked list below.\nWe have included every club that featured in any of the top 10 lists above and it is now up to you to put the clubs in order, starting with who you think is the biggest.\nOf course, we know lots of football fans will argue that their club is the biggest so if you think we've left anyone out, leave it in the comments below!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c337xrmr5keo"}
