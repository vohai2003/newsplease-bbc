Two back to back losses and ready to pack it in. Then a boss run and my world changed forever.\n\"We have one more adjustment to make and I believe that will make all the difference in the world. [Being] the smallest in the division makes it tough when the opponents are so much bigger. So for me it's time to drop down and face the girls who are the same size!\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/mixed-martial-arts/66304063"}
