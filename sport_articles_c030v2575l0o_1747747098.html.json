It's not me and then staff and then players, we are all in it together.\n\"It's strange without him [Billy Sharp] around. He's someone I've got a lot of time for. I'll certainly keep in touch with him, and I've love to work with him again.\n\"In my short time here, I'd be interested to see if he thought he became a better captain and a better leader, because I certainly think he did.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c030v2575l0o"}
