But doing nothing is not an option and no-one wants to see the building deteriorate.''\nThe 1939 building has a history that includes Pink Floyd, Blur and \"grab-a-granny\" discos.\nThe council said the building was returned in a poor state and a number of surveys had been carried out to work out the costs of bringing the building back into use.\nAn independent report looked at demolition and redevelopment for leisure, residential, hotel, senior living or care home options.\nDemolition and redevelopment by the council has been ruled out at this stage, and instead it is recommended the local authority marketed the freehold for three months, and reconsidered options if it failed to attract a buyer.\nThe council said it had received an offer to lease the Ocean Room but the costs involved meant that was not a viable solution.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrxy5g6jezo"}
