The Robins have not won four in succession at Ashton Gate whilst keeping a clean sheet in each since January 2004.\nEach of Blackburn's past six away league games have either been 1-0 (W3 D1 L2) or 1-1. They last scored more than once on the road against Cardiff in November (3-1), and last conceded more than once against Plymouth in October (1-2).", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz6p3617d0eo"}
