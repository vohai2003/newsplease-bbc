The hosts levelled it up four minutes before the break, though, as Lisbie cut inside and picked out the bottom corner.\nBarnet, eight points clear of York at the top of the table, enjoyed chances to retake the lead throughout the second half, with Stead notably seeing a close-range effort scrambled away by the Braintree defence.\nBut when Joe Grimwood was sent off in the 87th minute, Akinde – who scored 90 times across his four seasons with the Bees – converted the resulting penalty to inflict a first defeat since October on his former employers.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cg5q6v94601t"}
