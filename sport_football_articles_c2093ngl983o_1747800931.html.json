We can only manage ourselves. It's important we just try to pick up our three points where we can,\" Riza said.\n\"We have to recover and go again. We've got six more games and six more opportunities to get out of that position.\n\"I've felt confident all along. It's just these little moments that are important, where you've got to make it count.\"\nCardiff improved in the second half at Loftus Road after Riza made a triple substitution at half-time, and the Bluebirds boss says he was trying to chase victory rather than settling for a point.\n\"We made changes because we wanted to win the game. I felt we looked a bit leggy. We wanted to change it up,\" he added.\n\"The changes made a difference in the second half but we couldn't quite do enough to get that goal.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2093ngl983o"}
