Crystal Palace have been much improved in the past few weeks and have built a bit of momentum after only losing one of their past nine league games.\nI definitely do not see the Eagles losing this and although it will be tight, they are the team who I think will find a way of winning it, probably through Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c15z4x179vqo"}
