It wasn't easy with 10 players behind the ball in the box.\n\"We missed the third goal to be more relaxed, it's never over. But pleased for a good performance.\n\"We never give up to find the third goal. A performance that nothing wrong happened, everyone focussed, we missed a third goal that's all.\"\nOn Jack Grealish: \"Not easy when you don't play regularly. Goal good for him and playing in a more central position, he's more comfortable on the sides. He's playing really good.\"\nOn Omar Marmoush: \"Everyone has to be involved, the players closer to the box and the goal. He has a good sense, good numbers for the short time he's been with us. Dynamic, good pressing, really pleased for him.\"\nOn Oscar Bobb: \"He's struggled a lot. He's fought a lot to come back from the injury, a long time ago he's struggled a lot. I'm really pleased how the people take care of him and the fans are pleased for him. Step by step, he's back.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2vlrxz2pjo"}
