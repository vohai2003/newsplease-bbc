There's three or four instances in the game from Franco that I wasn't happy with, aimed at me.\"\nHe added: \"I'm not going to divulge what happened. I put down what I felt happened to the FA. Hopefully they'll read it and show some compassion. But that's it, I accept whatever decisions are made.\"\nAn independent regulatory commission imposed the sanctions and is due to publish its written reasons in due course, the FA says.\nA brace from Callum Robinson and Dimitrios Goutas' header earned Cardiff an emphatic victory over Luke Williams' Swansea side on 18 January.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm23lzpn605o"}
