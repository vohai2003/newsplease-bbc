In moments we played good but I think it was much better against Leicester. We lost some energy but there were some improvements, so that is alright.\"\nOn the supporters being nervous: \"I don't know why. I can understand that we are not up to the level, but they should support us because the effort is there and we are still winning 4-1.\n\"I don't understand what is happening. The team gave maximum effort. The level has to be higher, but we understand that.\"\nOn their form improving: \"We understand a bit more what we have done in the last 10 years and how hard it is. At the moment, we are a bit below that. We are working really hard and the team is coming back fitness wise.\n\"There were moments we played well, other moments less. It is a bit of an improvement but we understand it still has to be better.\n\"You don't put yourself down too much. We have not been at the level this year. Everybody said: 'City are winning all the time, it must be easy' - but it's not.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy53z534pgxo"}
