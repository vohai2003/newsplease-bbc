The team showed that they can be direct and effective when they need to be. The main thing is we now have the chance to be within two points at the split and the rest of the bottom six will be very concerned if that happens.\nPaul: What a performance! I feel the manager deserved that, he's stayed true to his principles and tried getting the team to play good football. It's not always worked but that was the complete performance and a thoroughly deserved victory.\nGordon: Incredible. It shows we have a team in there. Delighted for everyone at the club. Now though we have to replicate this effort six more times and maybe, just maybe we can conjure up a great escape. Cue the music.\nLes: What a result, there wasn't a failure. Praying Drey Wright isn't serious with his knee, what a game set up at Tannadice now.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g2erdrrzzo"}
