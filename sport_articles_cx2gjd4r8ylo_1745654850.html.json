We live and breathe this club and my father felt that same way.\n\"And obviously through the passing of my dad, we felt that it was the right thing to do to continue this.\n\"I'm still a young guy, and my brother and I are wanting to carry the torch for my father. We love everything about this club and my mom, so it's something we're fully committed to.\"\nIan says the Gordon family's experience along with advice from Bournemouth owner Bill Foley and his Black Knight consortium - who invested in the club in March 2024 - will help them better manage finances moving forward.\nBlack Knight director Tim Bezbatchenko was alongside Gordon at the AGM.\n\"We know mistakes have been made,\" Gordon said.\n\"But we've learned so many lessons along that way, with the guidance of someone like Tim (from Black Knight) to help mentor me, but also help us make better decisions moving forward. I think we're in a really good spot.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cx2gjd4r8ylo"}
