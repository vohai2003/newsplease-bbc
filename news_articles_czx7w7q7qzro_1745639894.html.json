They're saying loads of things and getting quite animated. Let's keep cool heads,\" she said.\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said Vance was \"wrong, wrong, wrong\", adding that the UK \"stood by America\" for 20 years in Afghanistan.\nLiberal Democrat defence spokesperson Helen Maguire, a former captain in the Royal Military Police who served in Iraq, urged the UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, to call on Vance to apologise for the comments.\n\"JD Vance is erasing from history the hundreds of British troops who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" she said.\nShe later told the BBC Vance's comments \"were clearly referring to the UK and France\", adding that they were \"deeply disrespectful\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czx7w7q7qzro"}
