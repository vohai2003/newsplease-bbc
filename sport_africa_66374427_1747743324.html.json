But she failed to score from positions classed as big chances by analytics experts Opta against Canada and the Republic of Ireland.\nAs they have done since the very start of their teams' campaigns, both goalkeepers may have to continue adding to their reputations.\nHaving become the youngest goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet at the World Cup in 2019, Nnadozie returned four years later at the relatively ancient age of 22 to captain her team against Olympic champions Canada in the Super Falcons' opening game.\nThe Paris FC goalkeeper kept out a penalty by a player 18 years her senior when she stopped Christine Sinclair scoring at a record sixth World Cup tournament, leading Nigeria coach Randy Waldrum to laud the player of the match and praise a save that he said \"really lit the fire and made us realise there's still something to play for.\"\nIt means England cannot take scoring from the spot for granted against the player responsible for saving three successive penalties in a shootout against Cameroon in the 2019 African Games final.\nEarps has more freedom to advance forward in a team that kept more than 70% of possession in all of their group games, taking a total of 20 touches outside of her penalty area to Nnadozie's seven.\nIn England's opener, against a Haiti team who had been deceptively wayward with their shooting, Earps produced two excellent saves to preserve three points. The 30-year-old subsequently called on England to raise their standards, but Nigeria's historic struggle to score means they are likely to be more dependent on their goalkeeper keeping a clean sheet.\nNigeria took the lead at the finals for the first time courtesy of centre-back Ohale's bravery, going ahead against Australia after the defender bundled the ball in while taking a boot to the ribs.\nSeveral minutes of treatment followed for the 31-year-old, and her reward for helping her country through to the knockout stage is a likely tussle with new Arsenal signing Russo.\nOhale has been here before - starting Nigeria's 3-0 defeat to Germany in the last 16 in 2019 - and her aerial ability is one of her team's strengths in their quest for a first ever knockout stage win, underlined by the nine headed clearances she has made - four more than any other player who could take to the field in the last-16 tie.\nPart of Ohale and Nigeria's challenge will be judging where Russo is playing. The 24-year-old can act as something of a throwback centre-forward, with the physicality and poacher's instinct to match, but she spurned one big chance and did not score from six shots from inside the box against Haiti.\nThings were different against China, when a deft fourth-minute strike ended Russo's wait of more than five months for an international goal.\nAnother issue for Ohale is Russo's potential to drag her out of position and leave space for the likes of Chloe Kelly, Lauren Hemp and Georgia Stanway to find space in dangerous areas.\nOhale has spent all but six minutes of the tournament in a central defensive partnership with 21-year-old Reims defender Oluwatosin Demehin. Should they continue together against England, the understanding they have formed is in for its sternest test yet.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/africa/66374427"}
