They've only lost one game all season so it was a good game and I think we created a few chances, probably could have created more.\n\"But I think our resilience as a team was good and we need to build on that because we've got a tough few games - that's what the Premier League is all about - playing the best teams.\"\nHe added: \"I think we've always had that resilience, that grit and determination to keep the ball out of the net and not just from the back four and myself. It's the full team putting a shift in.\n\"It's how do we improve that 10 per cent, quality with the ball, how do we create more chances? We become an even better team - keep pushing and getting better as a unit.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdrgdpje682o"}
