I'm not too far from Old Trafford, and it doesn't look good at the moment.\nBirmingham Phoenix v Trent Rockets abandoned\nUnfortunately, the rain has won at Birmingham.\nThe women's game between Phoenix and Trent Rockets has been abandoned - the second of the day after Manchester Originals and London Spirit suffered the same fate earlier.\nThat means only three games in the women's competition have been completed so far because of the weather.\nOriginals 138-5\nMatthew Wade slides along by the boundary to stop a four, but he's gesticulating to the umpires about the conditions out in the deep. He's never short of a word or two at the best of times, is the ex-Australia keeper-batter.\nOriginals 126-4\nAshton Turner is the new batter, and he gets the chance to shine at a free hit when Ravi Bopara sends down a beamer as the ball slips out of his hands.\nTurner can only get two from the free hit when he pulls it behind square.\nWICKET\nButtler b Bopara 62 (Originals 117-4)\nOhhhh, that is clever from Ravi Bopara!\nHis slower one is just too good for Jos Buttler, and his entertaining knock is over much to the disappointment of the home crowd.\nAnd there's a nice, laid-back celebration from the ex-England player just to rub it in.\nOriginals 117-3\nRavi Bopara is on with his wobbly medium-pacers from the Brian Statham End.\nJos Buttler gets two more when Dan Lawrence fumbles a long barrier in the offside, allowing the Originals skipper back for the second. Is a bowler allowed to shout at his skipper when that happens?\nWICKET\nEvans b Dawson 1 (Originals 113-3)\nWell, that didn't last long.\nDawson tempts Evans to come down the track but he gets some purchase off the pitch, it squeezes between bat and pad and clips the bails.\nPaul Walter joins Jos Buttler.\nWICKET\nHolden st Rossington b Critchley 24 (Originals 111-2)\nThe left-hander is lured down the track by the leg-spinner, and Adam Rossington makes a smart stumping to send him on his way.\nLaurie Evans is the new batter at the crease.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/cricket/66306712"}
