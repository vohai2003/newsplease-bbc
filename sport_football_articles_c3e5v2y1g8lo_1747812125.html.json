The rewards or consequences go far beyond that.\nRuben Amorim will know that victory in Bilbao will ease the pressure bowing down on him just six months into his reign after an atrocious start in domestic competition.\nHe will be a coach under scrutiny from week one next campaign. Not only would an early trophy add credit to the bank, but there is also a financial incentive that can fast-track his rebuild.\nChampions League football is said to be worth at least Â£100m, which would significantly boost Amorim's transfer aspirations in a crucial summer.\nThe offer of such a stage would undoubtedly add some much-needed allure to a team that will finish this season at the depths of the Premier League.\nAmorim needs to oversee drastic upgrades in his squad if he is to repeat his inspiring turnaround at Sporting in Manchester.\nBut it goes without saying that no European football would severely limit those changes and delay his progress. He may not get another summer.\nAnd when does pride come into it? Tottenham are the opponents at the San Mames Stadium, a club without major silverware since 2008.\nIt would be the most damning nadir of United's post-Sir Alex Ferguson decline yet if they are beaten by Spurs in a European final.\nWednesday night's showpiece is a football match that could launch this club's trajectory one of two very different ways.\nAlmost a year since that shock FA Cup triumph over Manchester City, does this team have one more surprise performance in them?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3e5v2y1g8lo"}
