For three brief minutes on Saturday afternoon we had eaten up all 10 of the points we were adrift by.\nA Simon Murray equaliser and a share of the spoils away to Dundee wasn't a disaster. It wasn't a must-win game, more a must not lose.\nWith that achieved and momentum still on our side, it's still a two-horse race for the trap door, but I still fancy us to upset the odds. Again.\nThe Scottish Cup quarter-final at Livingston this weekend will be a great gauge to see how we fare against a title contender. We might just be facing one of them come the end of May.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/czrny8gn170o"}
