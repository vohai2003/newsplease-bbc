Why you? Did you suffer? How could someone think that little of you that they would risk your life?\n\"The only thing that keeps me going is thinking that every new day is one day closer to me seeing you again.\n\"I love you endlessly my sunshine boy.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdel2n90grno"}
