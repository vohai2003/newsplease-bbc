I think in the first 10-15 minutes, the gaffer could have changed everyone.\n\"It's part of it. We help him in that case. Everybody's talking to him.\n\"In the last two training sessions, you see he's there, he's working hard and trying to do his best. He's such a good player. He will easily go on from this.\n\"Everybody's learning, us as well. We need to take care of him. We need to help him. He needs to help us. It's a two-way street.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cy0dxg75jelo"}
