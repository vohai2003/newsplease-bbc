We controlled the game and since the first minute I felt the players were trying to play and we managed to score two goals.\n\"The sending off changed the game a bit but the fight the fans showed and the fans helped a lot and we fully deserved the three points.\n\"There are some moments that are really hard but that's natural in every profession, you need to suffer.\"\nOn Patrick Dorgu, who was at fault for a goal and then got sent off: \"Players can have a mistake like Patrick today. The sending off, he wants to play the ball.\n\"He is ready for the Premier League. Last week he had a good performance against Everton, today they [the critics] will say he is not experienced enough for the Premier League, but I don't feel that way.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce3448yzvgko"}
