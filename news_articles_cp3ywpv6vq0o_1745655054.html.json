This is because of the one-way restriction on Southfield Drive.\nElly Cutkelvin, assistant city mayor for housing, said: \"The redevelopment of the vacant and disused Newry and Southfield school sites for new housing represents an important step in our wider strategy to address the housing crisis in the city.\n\"I'm pleased that construction work is now able to get under way on this complex and exciting project.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3ywpv6vq0o"}
