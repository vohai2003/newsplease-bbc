You can control the performances and I thought the players put in a good performance today.\n\"When we have lost matches we have been down but we've known what we needed to do. We can't stop doing the things we're good at. This gives us something to be happy about. We can't think we've turned a corner, that's the worst thing was can think.\n\"When we can play this way, we defend better as well. From that point on our game looks more complete. It's still very fragile. Overall I was very pleased.\"\nThelin 'saw some good things' from Dons\nFT: Elgin City 0-3 Aberdeen\nJimmy Thelin praised fourth-tier hosts Elgin but expressed relief that his Aberdeen side were able to end a 12-game run without being able to celebrate a win with their fans.\n\"We have been through a difficult time,\" the manager tells BBC Scotland. \"With the crowd we had today, it was important everyone knew the importance of the game to us.\n\"Allan Hale [opposition manager] and Elgin had a lot of energy and had a good performance in the first half and pushed us a lot. It was a difficult game and all credit to them - they didn't give up.\n\"The first half was not strong and they were good. They were almost through our back line tow or three times and we can't give those kind of chances in this type of game.\n\"In the end, I saw some good things from our team also.\"\nThelin has previously expressed his desire to sign a new striker during January.\n\"At least we are creating chances,\" he adds.\n'Job done' for Hibs\nFT: Hibernian 3-0 Clydebank\nHibernian manager David Gray tells BBC Scotland: \"I'm happy, job done in terms of getting into the next round.\n\"Massive credit to Clydebank to keep going the way they did. It was a great day for them and their supporters, they supported their team right to the end and encouraged them to keep going.\n\"The message before the game was to try and maintain the standards we've set in recent weeks. We became a bit sloppy in the first half but the second half was miles better, much more like us.\n\"Everybody came through the game which was important. All in all a really good day's work.\n\"We're delighted to be in the hat, that's the main thing, we'll see who we get and go from there.\"\nGOAL Ross County 2-3 LIVINGSTON\nAndrew Shinnie\nSurely that's the winner!\nMeshack Ubochioma's cross is nodded down to Andrew Shinnie in the box and he has all the time in the world to take a touch and fire home.\nIt was like the County keeper and defence had resigned themselves to losing that goal.\nLivingston fans are on the pitch, the stewards are trying to hold them back. All the miles in the buses and cars will be worth it now.\nWell fans fuming\nFT: St Johnstone 1-0 Motherwell\nKheredine Idessane\nBBC Scotland at McDiarmid Park\nSome of the Motherwell fans around me were absolutely furious with what they've seen. They came in large numbers, making up at least half the crowd, but were let down by a poor showing from their injury-depleted side.\nSt Johnstone, on the other hand, are cock-a-hoop. Home boss Simo Valakari celebrated on the pitch at the end of a potentially big win. It's a first victory in 10 games and a place in the fifth round draw. Fully deserved.\nSaints were good today, with Makenzie Kirk and new signing Victor Griffith causing Motherwell all sorts of problems. The 1-0 score probably flatters Motherwell. They huffed and puffed but rarely troubled home keeper Andy Fisher.\nIs this the turning point Valakari was hoping for?\nPromising Dunfermline debut for boss Tidser\nFT: Dunfermline Athletic 3-0 Stenhousemuir\nJane Lewis\nBBC Sport Scotland at East End Park\nThis was a comfortable afternoon for the Pars, with new manager Michael Tidser in the dugout and new owners perhaps watching stateside.\nRarely troubled, the Championship side will take confidence from their display. They were good on the ball with some lovely link play between the midfield and out wide. Defensively, when called upon, they were solid.\nThey'll be hoping this result can be used as a springboard for the league. But right now they'll just be enjoying the fact that they're through to the next round of the Scottish Cup.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cj3emln0rgpt"}
