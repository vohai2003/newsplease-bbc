Skipper Scott McTominay got stuck in and Onana finished the game with an outstanding 50-yard pass to Marcus Rashford from the edge of his area.\nMainly, though, it is a game that will be quickly forgotten - and Ten Hag will hope for improvement in the final two pre-season games against Lens and Athletic Bilbao at the weekend.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c3gddzy9y0xo"}
