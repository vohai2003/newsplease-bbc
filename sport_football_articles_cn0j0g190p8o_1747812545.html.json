The lads are in good shape.\"\nWrexham were 3-0 winners over Saturday's opponents Exeter City when the sides met at the Stok Racecourse in November.\nExeter are unbeaten in their last six league games and Parkinson is expecting a tough test against Gary Caldwell's men.\n\"The Exeter challenge is another interesting one,\" Parkinson added.\n\"They've had an upturn in form recently but we got down there in really good spirits.\n\"They had a period where they were getting drawn into the relegation battle â€“ the recent form has given them a bit of breathing space.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn0j0g190p8o"}
