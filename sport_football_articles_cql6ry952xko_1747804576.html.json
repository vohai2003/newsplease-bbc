There's a new one out which charts the journey of Liverpool lifting the 2019 Champions League under former manager Jurgen Klopp.\nReds keeper Alisson and Andy Robertson provide the insight from the dressing room, with former assistant manager Peter Krawietz talking about the plan to turn \"doubters to believers\" after Klopp's appointment in October 2015.\nLiverpool's ex-director of research Ian Graham goes into the club's 'Moneyball' approach to recruitment, including how Klopp was convinced to sign Mohamed Salah rather than Julian Brandt.\nThere are some great stories from the club winning Europe's top competition for a sixth time, including how they overturned a 3-0 semi-final, first-leg deficit to beat a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona 4-0 at a raucous Anfield.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cql6ry952xko"}
