Guardiola reinforced that view in stating his reasons for wanting the 22-year-old to stay - but he didn't completely close the door on a departure.\n\"It is a club decision,\" said Guardiola. \"Absolutely, I understand (his feelings). I was a football player and have empathy.\n\"We don't want anyone unsatisfied but in the middle of the season with the problems that we've had, I have the feeling that we need him.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy7wgq07deo"}
