Liverpool have had a phenomenal season but I think they've got their work cut out to beat PSG - I really do. I think it will be tight going to Anfield.\n\"I wouldn't rule anything out in this tie. I think that is the tie of the round and Liverpool have been phenomenal this season.\n\"Can they do the Champions League double along with the Premier League? Of course ,they've got the Carabao Cup final coming up and for them to be in this position, at this stage of the competition, nobody saw this coming from Arne Slot.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c8j01dw9n01o"}
