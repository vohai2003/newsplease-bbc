The game should have been put to bed much, much earlier.\nThey were dominating and with the changes that Rangers had to make they didn't really carry much threat going forwards.\nI don't think [Harry] Maguire covered himself in glory [for Rangers' goal], but [Cyriel] Dessers had a great touch and certainly you think Rangers are going to come away with a point.\nBut as we have seen so often, Manchester United can still click into a different gear. It was a great cross from [Lisandro] Martinez and fantastic finish [from Bruno Fernandes] trough Butland's legs.\nIt is all about the result, all about winning for United to put a bit of a smile back on faces.\nIt puts a bit more confidence back in them too.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1jgwg72xy2o"}
