Southampton are the only team to have scored fewer, and finding the net is clearly an issue for Sean Dyche's side.\nEverton capitulated against Bournemouth at Goodison Park in August, losing 3-2 after leading 2-0 with three minutes to go, but it is hard to make a case for them this time because of their lack of firepower.\nBournemouth denied me some prediction points with their late equaliser against Fulham on Sunday and there is a reason they are in seventh place - they create a lot of chances, and I am expecting them to edge this.\nMcCabe's prediction: 3-1\nBournemouth will win this comfortably.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyje53vvy2o"}
