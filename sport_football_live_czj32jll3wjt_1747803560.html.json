In the second half it was about managing the game without the ball, which was important.\n\"The lads are such a top group to work with. We are able to move on quickly, which is a strength of the group, and we were able to find a way to win. In terms of managing the game and being professional, we did that well.\n\"There are goals in this group of players, as we can see. There was some top play, not only in our goals, but other chances. We got into some good areas and if you keep doing that you will score eventually.\n\"We had an honest meeting yesterday about what we can do better, how we can improve. We need to be tough on ourselves, not hide away, and the players were open to that.\"\nStoke manager Mark Robins told BBC Radio Stoke:\n\"We had more possession and didn't have a shot on target, which is a damning statistic, and one I'm embarrassed about.\n\"We have to win the duels, have an attacking intent and get that impetus by playing in a way that you mean it, rather than the apologetic performance we've just seen. The players are more capable than that â€“ they know that.\n\"Everyone who pays their hard-earned money deserves the minimum, which is a side that's running and fighting. We are working hard, but not in the right way. Mentally, we weren't at it.\n\"We have to be miles better than that, and have the intent and a desire to score goals. These are young players who tend to be resilient but, in a game, can sometimes get overawed. There were two moments in the game where we switched off, allowing them to shoot and score.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/czj32jll3wjt"}
