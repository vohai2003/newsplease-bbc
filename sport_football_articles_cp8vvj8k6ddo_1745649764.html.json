I remember that one because I got that prediction wrong.\nPeople are talking about Newcastle being distracted by their upcoming Carabao Cup final against Liverpool [on 16 March] but could they actually be in line for a domestic cup double this season?\nI am banking on them keeping that possibility alive here. They obviously could really do with having Isak back but, even if he is not fit, then surely Brighton cannot win there twice this season... can they?\nSutton's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\nListen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp8vvj8k6ddo"}
