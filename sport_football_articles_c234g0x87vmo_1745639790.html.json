This season they have been in every game but it's a case of not taking their chances before the teams with top quality put theirs away. That is what has killed us because we can't get back into games.\n\"There are still loads of points to play for, so I'm still not ruling us out [of staying up]. The job is obviously very difficult but because of the way we are playing, I can't rule us out.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c234g0x87vmo"}
