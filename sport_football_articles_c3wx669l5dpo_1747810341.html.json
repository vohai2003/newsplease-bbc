We had to deal with that threat, that ball as well as we'd done the majority of the game.\n\"But in that period, the goal against us came which was the only blemish on what was a really good afternoon for us.\"\nThe performance was one of the best since Robins arrived in Staffordshire on New Year's Day.\nThe Potters managed 20 touches in QPR's box and dispossessed Rangers 16 times across the 90 minutes.\n\"The performance was really good from minute one,\" added Robins.\n\"We moved the ball really well, we created some spaces, down the right hand side in particular with Junior and Million but also on the left hand side with Eric (Bocat) and (Bae) Jun-ho.\n\"I'm delighted for him (Tchamadeu) as well because his performance today deserved that, deserved a win.\n\"Milly (Manhoef) as well his performance was really strong and I was really pleased to see him return from international duty in the manner that he did because his Thursday training was as good as I've seen from him.\"\nRobins will be hoping for a repeat when Stoke visit Preston North End next Saturday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3wx669l5dpo"}
