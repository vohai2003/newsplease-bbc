We were hardly likely to be party poopers were we?\nA 2-0 loss to Everton in the final game at Goodison Park after 133 years went like a dream for the locals.\nIt was always going to be an emotional day, and going down inside six minutes was effectively curtains. The opening 45 minutes would only get worse. Iliman Ndiaye doubled his and the hosts' lead in first-half injury time.\nThings did pick up slightly. Opting not to start with a natural striker, Simon Rusk made his changes with Ross Stewart and Cameron Archer entering the fray after 60 minutes, and both registered a shot each on target. The only two of the game. Stewart certainly has something to prove over the rest of the starters.\nRusk defended his decision not to start with a natural front man, stating: \"It is easy in hindsight. It's the same team as we played against Man City in many respects.\"\nIt's yet another result that hits hard, as we've seen no improvement at a consistent level. The resilient defending against Manchester City deserted them early, and they were never able to recover. With the dreaded 11-point target reached, you felt as if the team would never have it in them to come from behind. Especially with a raucous Goodison atmosphere.\nIf playing for pride has gone, then what is left?\nWe are ahead of Derby's point total. We're ahead on goals scored, but are tied with 29 defeats. A final day loss would see another unwanted record. Another is goals conceded. We currently sit on 84 while Derby finished with 89 goals against. Yes, it's really come to this. Let's take all the positives we have left.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c706z5pe1l5o"}
