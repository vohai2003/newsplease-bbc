For the supporters, it's an amazing night.\n\"It's a privilege to be here and manage here. There's been so many critics of Celtic at this level, and there's no doubt it is a challenge at this level, but the players have stepped up. They've been absolutely superb.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4gx2pk8zl4o"}
