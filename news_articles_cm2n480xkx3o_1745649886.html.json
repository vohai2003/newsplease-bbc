Other reliefs may help reduce the amount owed, but concern remains high.\nSpeaking from Fairview dairy farm near Bangor, the Conservative Party leader said: \"We want farmers to know that we are with you, we understand.\n\"Taxing those assets to force farmers to often give up their land and their children or their grandchildren to not continue in this way of life, I believe, is immoral.\n\"We are doing everything we can to fight the family farms tax.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2n480xkx3o"}
