SRM has declined to comment.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Surrey on Monday, Forster said: \"Sir Robert McAlpine say there's a microclimate around part of the building that is resulting in some of the panels either coming loose or falling off.\"\nA microclimate, according to the Met Office, is a \"distinctive climate of a small scale area\" that may be \"subtly different to the conditions prevailing over the area as a whole\".\nAreas with lots of tall buildings can disrupt the airflow and create strong gusts of wind.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6137ljjwqo"}
