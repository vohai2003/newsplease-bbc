I'm telling you,\" Redknapp is seen saying in a video clip obtained by the Guardian., external\n\"Seriously, he's been sent over to [expletive] us up. He has. I'm telling ya, he's like Lord Haw Haw in the war â€“ 'We have your best soldiers captured' and all that.\"\nWilliam Joyce, known as Lord Haw-Haw, broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK during World War Two.\nRedknapp also imagined an instruction given to Tuchel to \"go over and ruin that team\".\nAnd he appeared to make a Nazi salute gesture as he made the comments to the audience, who were laughing.\nBBC Sport has approached Redknapp for comment.\nThe incident has prompted some criticism of Redknapp on social media, though German comedian Henning Wehn - a regular guest on BBC Radio 5 live's Fighting Talk - said: \"What a non-story. Lighten up! If we're not allowed a bit of banter, what's the point of football? Or anything.\"\nTuchel is the third foreign permanent England manager after Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello.\nAsked about that fact in October, he said \"sorry I have a German passport\". Earlier this month, he said he needed to \"earn the right\" to sing the national anthem.\nFormer Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel led Chelsea to the 2020-21 Champions League in his previous spell working in England.\nRedknapp was the last English manager to win a major domestic trophy - the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth - before Eddie Howe led Newcastle to victory in this year's Carabao Cup final.\nRedknapp's last managerial role was at Birmingham City in 2017. He also had spells with Bournemouth, Southampton, QPR and the Jordan national team.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cddy11j9p98o"}
