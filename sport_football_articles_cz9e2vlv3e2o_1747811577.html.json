He has got to be careful because that kind of indiscipline can rub off on your players.\nThis game will be tight - I certainly don't see Brighton capitulating the way they did at Forest, but the key thing for them is Yasin Ayari and Carlos Baleba being fit to return in midfield.\nEven if they both return, I still feel like Chelsea will find a way of winning the tie. It may go all the way to penalties, but I am going to say Enzo Maresca's side will win it in extra time.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz9e2vlv3e2o"}
