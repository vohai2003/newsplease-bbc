There was no fight and no passion, nothing there at all. A slight improvement in the second half but, like most of the season, not good enough at all. The leadership at the top has a lot to answer for, with the appalling recruitment and total inability to right the wrongs.\nRussell: Any team that loses to Tottenham deserves to be relegated, end of.\nDaz: Absolutely abysmal! They deserve to be relegated after a poor and gutless season, with no fight shown. There has been no organisation from the top to the bottom of the club. The players don't care because they will move on to other clubs. The whole club, from the board downwards, needs rebuilding! It's embarrassing to be a Saints supporter.\nChris: Southampton are marching into history!", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62xqj59ezyo"}
