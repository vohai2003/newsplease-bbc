They’ve done that a lot better in the second half.\n\"Brucey comes up with the goal. I was probably the only one in the stadium shouting don't shoot, pass, pass, but he took a shot on, 30 yards on his right foot for a terrible angle and it goes in. So that's football.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cl7nkkp0w17o"}
