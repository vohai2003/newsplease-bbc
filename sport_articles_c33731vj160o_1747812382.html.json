He's obviously played at a high level and we are starting to see his quality come through.\n\"He and Ryan Alebiosu are more like wingers, they have given us a different dimension in terms of going forward and the creativity of the side.\n\"So we are delighted to have signed Declan, hopefully there will be a few more in the coming weeks.''\nJohn, whose former clubs include Cardiff, Bolton and Rangers, said: \"I've really enjoyed it and that's one of the main reasons for wanting to continue my time here.\n\"The boys have been brilliant, it's a really good changing room. We've been playing well and we've got to take that into the next three games now.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c33731vj160o"}
