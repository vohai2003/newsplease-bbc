You can't give goals away like they did, they weren't outstanding goals, we were poor at dealing with the ball in the box, we didn't get tight enough or pick up men well enough.\n\"To go 2-0 down to a team like Burnley, you make it very hard for yourself. We scored the goal and got a lifelineâ€¦ I thought second half we were better than them if I am being honest.\n\"Will Fish will score that late chance nine times out of 10. Yousef Salech hit the post and crossbar, we had our chances, but the bottom line is we didn't pick up any points.\n\"But the second half was a lot more pleasing. I thought we were worth a point, but we left ourselves too much to do.\"\nBurnley boss Scott Parker said:\n\"I am pleased with the three points. We started superbly for 35 minutes, dominated and got our noses in front.\n\"We started the second half brightly but my only complaint is we probably should have put more daylight between us.\n\"At the end you need resilience and the ability to dig in and we had that. I thought the energy was impressive. We looked like a proper team who understood their roles.\n\"It's a shame we conceded tonight but I'm more pleased that we won. I was a little bit surprised we conceded, we will have to review it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cwyddw72221t"}
