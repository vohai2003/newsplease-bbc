Consequently, Al-Nassr now accept the deal will not happen.\nThe Saudi Pro-League transfer window closes on Friday evening.\nMitoma has made 92 appearances and scored 18 goals in all competitions since joining Brighton from J League side Kawasaki Frontale in 2021.\nThe winger is the only Brighton player to have featured in all 23 Premier League games so far this season, with Fabian Hurzeler's side currently ninth in the table.\nHe signed a contract extension in October 2023 that runs to June 2027.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2m33dmn7xo"}
