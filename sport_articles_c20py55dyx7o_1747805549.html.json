That was followed by situational football covering various end-of-half/end-of-game scenarios.\nThe team then hopped back on its fleet of buses and headed to the Superdome, where Sunday's game will take place, for a team photo.\nThey will relax for the rest of Saturday and have some night meetings, as they have done all season.\n\"You don't get to this point and change up what is important to your team and your core values,\" Sirianni added.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c20py55dyx7o"}
