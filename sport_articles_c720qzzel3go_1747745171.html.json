Yet again they have somehow managed to overpay for a transfer target.\"\nEdwards also expressed his concern about how good Hojlund is - cheekily suggesting United had got their Scandinavian strikers mixed up.\n\"His name sounds a bit like Haaland and he does have blond hair,\" he said. \"It's a bit like when a supermarket does a similar-named own product to a fancy, branded one.\n\"He is really young and it is an interesting transfer, so perhaps I am being unfair.\n\"Atalanta are laughing though. He only scored nine goals last season after they signed him for £10m in 2022.\n\"There will be a lot of expectation on him as the main striker at Manchester United and he needs to get off to a good start.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c720qzzel3go"}
