We hope Danjuma will give us that, but they will be looking for more as well.\"\nEverton spent a week training in the Alps, where the squad were put through their paces including Dyche's infamous 'Gaffer's Day' - a training session without balls and consisting of a large amount of running.\n\"It is not nice,\" said Keane. \"But you definitely feel good after it.\n\"It is a mental challenge, and there are times when you want to give up, but you just keep going, get back on that line, and run again.\n\"Everyone gave their best and everyone feels the benefits for it.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cv2jv1rpey1o"}
