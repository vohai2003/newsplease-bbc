We started well, went in front, but then Aberdeen were better. We were lucky to go in at half-time at just 2-1 down.\n\"We started well in the second-half, good in possession, had chances with Tom Sparrow and Luke Armstrong. For 3-1, we defended badly and that was that for us.\n\"What I'm not satisfied with, and what is not okay for me, is the last 15 minutes. We gave up, and I don't like that. It doesn't matter what the result is, we have to fight for 90 minutes. We will speak about this.\n\"I'm here five weeks now, and you learn each game and in training. Aberdeen are a brilliant team, I like how they play football, but in the last 15 minutes we gave up.\n\"The reaction from a couple of players was not okay. I hope we learn from this.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cdele869kryo"}
