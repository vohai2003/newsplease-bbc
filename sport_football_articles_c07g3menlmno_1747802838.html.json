We had to take him off at half-time with some muscular issues,\" Arteta said.\nThe Gunners are already missing Saka with a long-term hamstring injury and Raheem Sterling with a knee injury. Kai Havertz missed the game at Brighton with illness and captain Martin Odegaard was only well enough for the bench, after also suffering with illness.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c07g3menlmno"}
