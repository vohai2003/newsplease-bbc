Rangers have brought in a lot of new recruits but it might just be too much for them to topple their big rivals.\nKenny Miller: My heart wants to say Rangers, but that's not with any real confidence. Since Michael Beale arrived it's been nip and tuck between the Old Firm and I think they are far stronger all over the pitch. I can't call it though, I really feel it could be one of the closest title races in a while.\nLeanne Crichton: Celtic are favourites because they have maintained the strength of their squad and then there's the stability of bringing a manager like Brendan Rodgers back.\nStephen Craigan: Celtic have more continuity regards players than they did at this time last season and I think that really helps. When you look at Rangers, they have made lots of changes and we don't really know what they will bring.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crgj17xx573o"}
