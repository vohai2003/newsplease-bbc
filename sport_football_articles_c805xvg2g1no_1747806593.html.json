If you are not at a high level each week in the Premier League then you get exposed and that is exactly what happened last weekend.\n\"This season they have, in general, responded very well following a defeat but this is another occasion where the fans will be hoping they do.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c805xvg2g1no"}
