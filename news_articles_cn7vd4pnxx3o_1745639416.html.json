An airport, two seaports and an industrial zone would be built during the third phase, which would take another two years and cost $30bn.\nThe Arab plan also proposes that an \"administrative committee\" made up of independent Palestinian technocrats run post-war Gaza for a transitional period while \"working towards empowering the Palestinian Authority to return\".\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and others - took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting forces from the Fatah-dominated PA in violent clashes a year after winning parliamentary elections. The PA was left governing parts of the occupied West Bank.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA, told the summit that he welcomed the Arab plan and urged Donald Trump to support it.\nHamas said it appreciated \"the Arab position rejecting attempts to displace our people\".\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any future role in Gaza for Hamas or the PA.\nHowever, Israel's foreign ministry swiftly rejected the Arab League's statement endorsing the Egyptian plan, saying it \"fails to address the realities of the situation following 7 October 2023, remaining rooted in outdated perspectives\".\n\"Now, with President Trump's idea, there is an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will. This should be encouraged!\" it added.\n\"Instead, Arab states have rejected this opportunity, without giving it a fair chance, and continue to level baseless accusations against Israel.\"\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the Arab plan did \"not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"\nThe Assistant Secretary General of the Arab League, Hossam Zaki, told the BBC on Wednesday that Trump's approach was unacceptable.\n\"It is based on the forced displacement of Palestinians out of their homes and of their land. This is against international law and, we have said this time and again, this is not a way to treat this man-made crisis,\" he said.\n\"This is a war that has been waged by Israel partly with the aim of driving Palestinians out of their territory,\" he added.\nHe also described the Israeli foreign ministry's response to the Arab plan as \"against humanity and against morals\".\nPalestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba - the Arabic word for \"catastrophe\" - when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.\nMany of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three-quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nMore than 48,400 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn7vd4pnxx3o"}
