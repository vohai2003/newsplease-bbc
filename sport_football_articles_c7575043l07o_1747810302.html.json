It is important that we analyse the reasons internally and it is important that we show a good reaction and try and improve on small things.\"\nOn Nottingham Forest's set-up making it difficult for his side: \"They sit in a low block and wait for transitional moments - that is their game. It is the game we expected because they never do anything else. They are successful like this and it is tough to play against them. We were unable to find solutions against them, especially in the first half. We were not on our highest level today.\"\nOn how the players are feeling that missed penalties: \"How should a player feel when he misses a penalty? They are disappointed but I take responsibility for the penalties. They are young players and will learn from it. They didn't shoot that bad, the Forest goalkeeper made two impressive saves. That is penalties.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7575043l07o"}
