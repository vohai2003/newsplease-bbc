I'm so happy that I could finish off for them.\"\nSpain's Juan Ayoso, racing for UAE Team Emirates XRG, keeps his place at the top of the general classification but Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe's Primoz Roglic has narrowed the gap between them to just one second.\nThe pair are pulling ahead with another Spaniard, Enric Mas, 21 seconds behind in third place.\nStage six, the penultimate day of the race, moves to the mountains for a 159km stretch.\nAlso on Friday, Mathieu van der Poel won the E3 Saxo Classic in Belgium for the second successive year.\nThe Dutch Alpecinâ€“Deceuninck rider launched a solo attack from 38km out to seal his third win from three races this season, crossing the line more than one minute before Lidl-Trek's Mads Pedersen.\nIneos Grenadiers rider Filippo Ganna was a further 59 seconds back.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/articles/cm2d2l38g81o"}
