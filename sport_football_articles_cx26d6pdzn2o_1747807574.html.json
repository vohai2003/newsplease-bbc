The League One promotion a year earlier had a certain amount of expectation attached given the financial clout of the club at that level, the Championship was now a different pond altogether.\nIpswich had absolutely no right to go head-to-head with three newly relegated sides in Leicester, Leeds and Southampton and their parachute payments gave them all a vastly superior advantage. To come out ahead of two of them with 96 points and finish only one point behind champions Leicester was an incredible achievement.\nWhat the other clubs did not have was the togetherness and never give up attitude which is now so instilled throughout the club, both on the field and off it. Whispers that we would fall away across the season and accusations of being 'lucky' given the amount of late goals scored were levelled at Town throughout the campaign but the players and management shut out the exterior noise and got on with the job with razor sharp focus and mentality. A 96th minute winner against Southampton in early April epitomised this attitude and resulted in celebrations and noise not seen at Portman Road for nearly a quarter of a century.\nThe final whistle on 4th May brought with it a release of 22 years of decline and, at times, despair. The sight of thousands of fans running onto the pitch to celebrate with the heroes that had delivered this moment was a sight I will never forget.\nWhat a moment, what a season, what a club.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx26d6pdzn2o"}
