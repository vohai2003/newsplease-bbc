We conceded a very easy goal. It was not a free-kick, but it can happen.\n\"But then it's still a free-kick near the halfway line and it's very difficult to concede from there, but then we lose two duels. It's not nice to concede like that.\n\"This could have been a good three points because we had a strong mindset and came back. It could have been good for the confidence, so I'm disappointed we didn't win the game.\n\"I still have three starts for West Ham United but I have had a difficult season. I'm still in the process, I'm still trying to adapt. I need minutes. It's not perfect, but I was out for 12 weeks. I think I feel very good, especially in the duels. I feel very strong right now. We did very intense rehab work.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly1n57vgl5o"}
