The previous low at Champions Retreat Golf Club was a seven-under 65 by Rose Zhang in 2023.\nThe opening two rounds of the event take place at Champions Retreat, with the tournament moving to Augusta National for the final day.\nScotland's Hannah Darling ended the opening round in a tie for 55th following a three-over-par round, while Englishwoman Patience Rhodes is a shot further back in a tie for 61st.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cly1g806l8vo"}
