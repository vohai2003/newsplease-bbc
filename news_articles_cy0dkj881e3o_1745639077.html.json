But how did the show all start?\nNamed after its founder Charles Cruft, the dog show took place for the first time in 1891 at the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington, where more than 2,000 dogs were entered.\nMr Cruft was an ambitious man who left college to sell \"dog cakes\" - food filled with meat, wheat and vegetables - having no desire to join the family jewellery business.\nHe was soon promoted to a travelling salesman, working with sporting kennels before later managing a terrier dog show in Westminster.\nNearly five decades later, Crufts celebrated its golden jubilee five years early in 1936, after breaking the 10,000 entries mark for the first time.\nDespite Mr Cruft dying two years later, his wife took over to ensure the dogs would keep on running with their prize-winning displays.\nAn Australian shepherd called Viking was crowned best in show at the 2024 show, beating 24,000 dogs from around the world.\nViking, co-owned by Melanie Raymond, John Shaw and Kerry Kirtley, was also the winner of the pastoral group at the show.\nMs Raymond, a third generation dog breeder who lives just three miles from the NEC, said: \"We all dream of winning best in show at Crufts.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0dkj881e3o"}
