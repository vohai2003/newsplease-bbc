Those same fans have long been crying out for him to be granted more opportunities on the field.\nPep Guardiola knows he is a unique talent, too. But so do other clubs, and an exit may not be too far away.\nYou would not be wrong to think that was a description of Cole Palmer's situation before his departure from Etihad Stadium back in 2023 and, in many ways, it does entirely suit.\nThis time, however, it is a reflection of the moment James McAtee finds himself in.\nA lifelong Manchester City fan, McAtee is emerging from the same youth squad that has thrust Palmer, Liam Delap, Romeo Lavia and Morgan Rogers into the Premier League limelight, but he has had to bide his time when it comes to sufficient chances in Guardiola's first-team squad.\nA moment of brilliant to create a second goal against Leicester City before the turn of the year reminded fans of just what can happen when the 22-year-old is given the licence to express himself freely on the pitch.\nAnd then came the FA Cup third round, and a sensational hat-trick and overall second-half showing to further stress just what a huge mistake Manchester City would be making to let go of such an elite young prospect.\nIt is time for Guardiola to show exactly why he worked so hard to keep hold of the player last summer, and give him chance to excel in a largely faltering City attacking set-up to help drive the club into a new and fresh generation.\nFailing that, you could be about to see the emergence of England's next world superstar... showcasing his talents at one of the continent's other great football clubs after being snapped up for a small fee.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8k7771er1o"}
