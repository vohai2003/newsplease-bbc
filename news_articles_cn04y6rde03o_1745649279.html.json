She was joined by a pod of dolphins at one point but has also dealt with swells of up to 4m (13ft).\n\"Being out in the middle of the Atlantic on my own, a lot of people say it must be quite lonely but I think a lot of people should experience this..,\" she said.\n\"A lot of the time we wake up and reach for our phones and scroll on social media or check our emails and we're immersed in what other people are needing or wanting or doing.\n\"I have to really tune in to my inner guru in a way and trust myself and have confidence in my ability which I lack.\"\nMs Park, who finished second in the 2017 cycling Matrix Fitness Grand Prix Series, is hoping to raise Â£300,000 for BBC Children in Need, The MS Society, the Alnwick Garden and the Clocktower Foundation.\nShe managed to speak to her family during her journey and the support had been amazing and kept her going, she said.\nOne of the first things she planned to do when back on dry land was have a shower and wash her hair and \"feel a little bit more human again\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn04y6rde03o"}
