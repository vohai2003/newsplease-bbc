There is no hard feelings, no-one is getting angry - he always does the best thing for the team.\n\"I think he is a good person and a good manager, we can learn a lot from him. He has a different perspective as a person who comes from a different culture. From any manager, you can learn a lot if you have that willingness to listen and improve.\n\"He has got a different view of football compared to Russell [Martin]. It's a great experience for the players that we can see how it works in Italy -the way we train, the meetings are different. It's something positive and fresh.\n'I like the way we defend. It's really aggressive and front-footed, but it's really hard. A lot of teams play like this in Italy, but over here it is a bit more unusual. Hopefully we can surprise the opposition with that.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c983p67p72ko"}
